    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with Curved Side Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The prism has the following dimensions: 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to `0.0`, `0.0`, and `-90.0` degrees, and the translation vector to `0.0, 0.1984, 0.0`. This will position the prism's base 0.1984 units above the ground plane. 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. The sketch should have a rectangle with a semicircle attached to one end. 3. To create the rectangle, follow these steps: a. Create a line from point `(0.0, 0.0)` to point `(0.2302, 0.0)`. b. Create a line from point `(0.2302, 0.0)` to point `(0.2302, 0.75)`. c. Create a line from point `(0.2302, 0.75)` to point `(0.0, 0.75)`. d. Create a line from point `(0.0, 0.75)` to point `(0.0, 0.0)` to close the rectangle. 4. For the semicircle: a. Create a line from point `(0.2302, 0)` to point `(0.2302, 0.375)`; this line marks the center of the semicircle. b. Create a circle with the center at `(0.2302, 0.375)` and a radius of `0.375`. c. Complete the semi-circular arc by constraining its end points to the end points of the line created at step 3(a). 5. Apply scale transformation to the drawing with the scaling factor of `0.75`. 6. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the rotation angles and translation vector set in the coordinate system. 7. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis according to the depth specified in the extrusion property. This will create the final rectangular prism with a curved side. Note that the height, width, and length of this prism are 0.5 units, 1 unit, and 2 units, respectively, as described in the input JSON.</description>",

The radii of these circles should be 0.375, 0.3375, and 0.3 units respectively. These circles define the faces of the cylindrical object (face_1, face_2, and face_3). 4. *Creating Loops*: Each face consists of two loops (loop_1 and loop_2) to create a closed profile. Circle_1 is used to create each loop. 5. *Scaling the Sketch*: Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 6. *Transforming the Sketch into 3D*: Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0375 units. This will create the 3D model of the cylindrical object with a central hole. **Part 2: Flared Cylindrical Object** 1. *Creating the Coordinate System*: Create a new coordinate system with the same orientation as the previous one (no rotation along any axis) but with a translation vector of [0.0375, 0.0375, 0]. 2. *Creating the 2D Sketch*: Draw a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the newly created coordinate system. 3. *Drawing Circles for Faces*: Within the sketch, draw two concentric circles with their centers at [0.3375, 0.3375]. The radii of these circles should be 0.3375 and 0.3 units respectively. These circles define the faces of the flared cylindrical object. 4. *Creating Loops*: Each face consists of a single loop created using circle_1. 5. *Scaling the Sketch*: Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.675. 6. *Transforming the Sketch into 3D*: Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.2062 units. The resulting object will be a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom, creating a slightly flared appearance.
