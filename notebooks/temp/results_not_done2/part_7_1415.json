    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional, Angular, and Jagged Shape with a Flat Base and a Pointed Top** The first part of the CAD assembly is a three-dimensional, angular, and jagged shape with a flat base and a pointed top. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the given euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translation vector `[0.0, 0.15, 0.0]`. This will establish the orientation and placement of the shape in the CAD model. **Creating the 2D Sketch for Part 1** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the established coordinate system. Follow the detailed steps below for sketching the face of part 1: 1. Draw **line 1** from the point `(0.0382, 0.125)` to point `(0.15, 0.0)`. 2. Draw **line 2** from the point `(0.15, 0.0)` to point `(0.2451, 0.0)`. 3. Draw **arc 1** from the point `(0.2451, 0.0)` to the point `(0.5049, 0.0)`. Use the midpoint `(0.375, 0.075)` for constructing the arc. 4. Draw **line 3** from the point `(0.5049, 0.0)` to point `(0.75, 0.0)`. 5. Draw **line 4** from the point `(0.75, 0.0)` upwards to point `(0.75, 0.45)`. 6. Draw **line 5** from the point `(0.75, 0.45)` horizontally to the left to point `(0.675, 0.45)`. 7. Draw **line 6** from the point `(0.675, 0.45)` diagonally downwards to the left to point `(0.375, 0.225)`. 8. Draw **line 7** from the point `(0.375, 0.225)` diagonally upwards to the right to point `(0.225, 0.45)`. 9. Draw **line 8** from the point `(0.225, 0.45)` horizontally to the left to point `(0.15, 0.45)`. 10. Draw **line 9** from the point `(0.15, 0.45)` downwards to point `(0.0382, 0.325)`. 11. Draw **arc 2** from the point `(0.0382, 0.325)` to the point `(0.0382, 0.125)`. Use the midpoint `(0.0, 0.225)` for constructing the arc. Once you have drawn all the sketched elements, apply the closure constraint to loop 1. If necessary, add other constraints like tangency, parallelism, and perpendicularity to ensure an accurate CAD model. **Transforming the 2D Sketch into a 3D Sketch** Using the given coordinate system information, rotate the 2D sketch by the provided euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translate it by the vector `[0.0, 0.15, 0.0]`. This will orient and position your fully defined sketch in the 3D space to prepare for the extrusion process. **Extruding the 2D Sketch to Generate a 3D Model** Extrude the 2D face along the normal while specifying the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value as 0.15 units. Leave `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` set as 0. This will create the 3D model of part 1 with the desired height and dimensions. Adjust the scale of the sketch using the `sketch_scale` value of 0.75, if necessary, to attain the desired proportions as described in the assembly JSON. These instructions should result in a perfect representation of the first part of the CAD assembly with the described shape and dimensions. Proceed to generate the required subsequent parts using the remaining provided JSON data and instructions in order to build the complete CAD assembly model.</description>",

Step 5: Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.75 units in the direction of the normal and 0.0 units in the opposite direction of the normal.
