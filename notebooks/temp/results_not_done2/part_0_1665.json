    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a curved top edge Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0, and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Sketch Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. In this sketch, create the following loops and curves: Loop 1 * Arc 1 + Start Point: (0.0, 0.1091) + Mid Point: (0.032, 0.032) + End Point: (0.1091, 0.0) * Line 1 + Start Point: (0.1091, 0.0) + End Point: (0.6409, 0.0) * Arc 2 + Start Point: (0.6409, 0.0) + Mid Point: (0.718, 0.032) + End Point: (0.75, 0.1091) * Line 2 + Start Point: (0.75, 0.1091) + End Point: (0.75, 0.3682) * Arc 3 + Start Point: (0.75, 0.3682) + Mid Point: (0.718, 0.4453) + End Point: (0.6409, 0.4773) * Line 3 + Start Point: (0.6409, 0.4773) + End Point: (0.1091, 0.4773) * Arc 4 + Start Point: (0.1091, 0.4773) + Mid Point: (0.032, 0.4453) + End Point: (0.0, 0.3682) * Line 4 + Start Point: (0.0, 0.3682) + End Point: (0.0, 0.1091) This loop has 8 curves (4 arcs and 4 lines) in total. Extrusion Extrude the sketch by 0.0273 units in the direction of the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction. Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch.
