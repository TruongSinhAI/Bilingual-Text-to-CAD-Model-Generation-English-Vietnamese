However, the JSON specifies \"   , \"extrude_depth_towards_normal\"   ,\" : 0.0 and \"   , \"extrude_depth_opposite_normal\"   ,\" : 0.375. This is a contradiction. The JSON indicates extrusion in the *opposite* direction of the normal. If the Z-axis is the normal, then 0.375 in the Z-axis implies `extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.375`. The JSON values are consistent with an extrusion of 0.375 units in the negative Z direction. The description should have specified \"   , \"opposite Z direction\"   ,\" or the JSON should have `extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.375`. \\n-The sketch_scale and operation match.\\n\\n-Correction: The description states \"   , \"Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.375 units\"   ,\". This should imply `extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.375`. However, the JSON has `extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.375`. This is a discrepancy. The JSON's extrusion values contradict the description's natural interpretation of \"   , \"along the Z-axis by 0.375 units\"   ,\" as positive extrusion. Given the JSON, the description *should* have specified \"   , \"extrude ... by 0.375 units in the negative Z direction\"   ,\" or \"   , \"opposite to the normal\"   ,\". Therefore, there is a mismatch in the extrusion direction interpretation.\\n</think>"
