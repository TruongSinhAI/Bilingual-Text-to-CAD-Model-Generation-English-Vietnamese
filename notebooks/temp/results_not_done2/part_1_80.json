However, the JSON's `coordinate_system` for `part_1` remains `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`, indicating the sketch is drawn on the XY plane at Z=0.

If the sketch is first translated to Z=0.2083 and then extruded by 0.2083, the body would be from Z=0.2083 to Z=0.4166.

This is consistent.\\n    *   Other parameters (sketch details, extrusion depths, scale, operation) for Part 2 match.\\n\\nCorrection: The \\\"Step 4\\\" translation for Part 1 in the description implies a Z-offset for the sketch *before* extrusion, which is not reflected in the JSON's `coordinate_system` for `part_1`. The JSON's `coordinate_system` for `part_1` is `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`, indicating the sketch is drawn on the XY plane at Z=0. This leads to an inconsistency in the initial placement of Part 1.
