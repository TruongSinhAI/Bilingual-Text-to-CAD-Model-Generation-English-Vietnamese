    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles as [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector as [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. Now, create the 2D sketch for this part, which will be drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. 1. Sketch face_1: Create a loop_1 on this face, which contains the following curves: a. line_1: Start Point: [0.0, 0.0] End Point: [0.5, 0.0] b. line_2: Start Point: [0.5, 0.0] End Point: [0.5, 0.25] c. line_3: Start Point: [0.5, 0.25] End Point: [0.2551, 0.5] d. line_4: Start Point: [0.2551, 0.5] End Point: [0.0, 0.2603] e. line_5: Start Point: [0.0, 0.2603] End Point: [0.0, 0.0] Since the prism has parallel and perpendicular faces, properly apply the necessary constraints to loop_1, such as making it a closed loop and aligning the lines according to right angles. Now you have created the 2D sketch. Scale this sketch by a factor of 0.5 using \"sketch_scale\" scaling parameter. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system. The final step is to extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Extrude the sketch with the following properties: - \"extrude_depth_towards_normal\": 0.75 - \"extrude_depth_opposite_normal\": 0.0 Please note that there will be no penetration of materials between this part and the potential preceding CAD models. It results in the creation of a new solid body. height: 0.5 width: 0.75 length: 2</description>",
