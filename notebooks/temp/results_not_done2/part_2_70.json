Create a rectangle by drawing four lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [2.801, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [2.801, 0.0], End Point [2.801, 0.2564] - Line 3: Start Point [2.801, 0.2564], End Point [0.0, 0.2564] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.2564], End Point [0.0, 0.0] 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** by a factor of 2.801 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** with the following transformation: - Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0957 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0957 - Sketch scale: 2.801 Part 2: Cut-Out Rectangular Prism Next, create a cut-out rectangular prism in the middle section of the previous prism. 1. **Create a new coordinate system** with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.75, 0.0, 0.1156] 2. **Generate a 2D sketch** on the XY plane of the new coordinate system: 1. Create a rectangle by drawing four lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.3827, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.3827, 0.0], End Point [0.3827, 0.0872] - Line 3: Start Point [0.3827, 0.0872], End Point [0.0, 0.0872] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0872], End Point [0.0, 0.0] 3. **Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** with the following transformation: - Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.3597 - Sketch scale: 0.3827\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description outlines two parts: \\\"Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Middle Section\\\" and \\\"Part 2: Cut-Out Rectangular Prism\\\".\\n\\npart_1: (Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Middle Section)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From \\\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\\")\\n--Translation Vector: [-2.051, 0.1913, 0.0] (From \\\"Translation Vector: [-2.051, 0.1913, 0.0]\\\")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1: (Implied as the canvas for the rectangle)\\n---loop_1: (From \\\"Create a rectangle by drawing four lines\\\")\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [2.801, 0.0] (From \\\"Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [2.801, 0.0]\\\")\\n----line_2: Start [2.801, 0.0], End [2.801, 0.2564] (From \\\"Line 2: Start Point [2.801, 0.0], End Point [2.801, 0.2564]\\\")\\n----line_3: Start [2.801, 0.2564], End [0.0, 0.2564] (From \\\"Line 3: Start Point [2.801, 0.2564], End Point [0.0, 0.2564]\\\")\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.2564], End [0.0, 0.0] (From \\\"Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.2564], End Point [0.0, 0.0]\\\")\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0957 (From \\\"Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0957\\\")\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0957 (From \\\"Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0957\\\")\\n--sketch_scale: 2.801 (From \\\"Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 2.801\\\" and \\\"Sketch scale: 2.801\\\")\\n--operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (Inferred from \\\"construct a rectangular prism\\\")\\n\\npart_2: (Cut-Out Rectangular Prism)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From \\\"Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\\")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.75, 0.0, 0.1156] (From \\\"Translation Vector: [0.75, 0.0, 0.1156]\\\")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1: (Implied as the canvas for the rectangle)\\n---loop_1: (From \\\"Create a rectangle by drawing four lines\\\")\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.3827, 0.0] (From \\\"Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.3827, 0.0]\\\")\\n----line_2: Start [0.3827, 0.0], End [0.3827, 0.0872] (From \\\"Line 2: Start Point [0.3827, 0.0], End Point [0.3827, 0.0872]\\\")\\n----line_3: Start [0.3827, 0.0872], End [0.0, 0.0872] (From \\\"Line 3: Start Point [0.3827, 0.0872], End Point [0.0, 0.0872]\\\")\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.0872], End [0.0, 0.0] (From \\\"Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0872], End Point [0.0, 0.0]\\\")\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0 (From \\\"Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0\\\")\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.3597 (From \\\"Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.3597\\\")\\n--sketch_scale: 0.3827 (From \\\"Sketch scale: 0.3827\\\")\\n--operation: \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" (Inferred from \\\"create a cut-out rectangular prism\\\")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check Part 1:\\n--Coordinate system: Euler angles and translation vector match.
