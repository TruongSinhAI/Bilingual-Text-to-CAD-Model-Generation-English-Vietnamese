Final Shape: Construct a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole running through its center The final shape of the CAD model is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole running through its center. The prism has a flat top and bottom, and the cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are 10 by 5 by 3 units, and the cylindrical hole has a diameter of 2 units. 1. Combine the two parts created earlier using the appropriate boolean operation (NewBodyFeatureOperation). 2. The resulting CAD model will have the following dimensions: - Length: 10 units - Width: 5 units - Height: 3 units - Cylindrical hole diameter: 2 units Note: The provided JSON data indicates that the final shape is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole running through its center. However, the JSON data for Part 1 and Part 2 do not match that description. Part 1 describes a rectangular prism with a curved top edge and a flat bottom edge, and Part 2 describes a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.

The JSON has extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0 and extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0017. This means the extrusion occurs in the direction opposite to the normal. While this is a valid way to extrude a body, the description could be more precise about the extrusion direction if it intends this specific mapping.\\n  - Correction identified: The description states \"  \n  , \"cylindrical hole\"  \n  , \" for Part 2, but the sketch data in the JSON (line_1 to line_4 forming a rectangle) defines a rectangular profile, not a circular one. Therefore, the resulting extruded part in the JSON would be a rectangular prism, not a cylinder. This is a fundamental mismatch between the described shape and the JSON's geometric definition of the sketch.\\n  - The operation is NewBodyFeatureOperation for both parts, which means they are created as separate bodies. The description states \"  \n  , \"cylindrical hole\"  \n  , \" for part 2 and that it \"  \n  , \"will be used to create a hollow center\"  \n  , \". This implies a boolean cut operation later, which is not part of this specific part's extrusion operation.
