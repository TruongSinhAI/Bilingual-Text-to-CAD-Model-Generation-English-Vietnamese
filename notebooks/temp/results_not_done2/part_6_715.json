Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and translation vector of (0.0, 0.3125, 0.0). 1. **Sketching the base:** - Draw a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the created coordinate system. - Create a closed loop with four curves - two lines and two arcs. - The first line starts at (0.0625, 0.0) and ends at (0.6875, 0.0). - The first arc starts at (0.6875, 0.0), has a mid point at (0.75, 0.0625), and ends at (0.6875, 0.125). - The second line starts at (0.6875, 0.125) and ends at (0.0625, 0.125). - The second arc starts at (0.0625, 0.125), has a mid point at (0.0, 0.0625), and ends at (0.0625, 0.0). 2. **Extruding the sketch:** - Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. - Extrude the scaled sketch along its normal vector by a depth of 0.0625. Parts 1, 2, and 3 combine to create the final shape, a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole on one end. **Intermediate CAD Part 2** Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered end. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and translation vector of (0.0455, 0.25, 0.0125). 1. **Sketching the base:** - Draw a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the created coordinate system. - Create a closed loop with a single circle. - The circle has its center at (0.05, 0.05) and a radius of 0.05. 2. **Extruding the sketch:** - Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.1. - Extrude the scaled sketch along its normal vector by a depth of 0.25. The first and second parts combine by joining their features to create the cylindrical hole in the rectangular prism. **Intermediate CAD Part 3** Construct a cylindrical object with a smaller cylindrical hole in the center, both with a reflective surface. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of (180.0, 0.0, -90.0) and translation vector of (0.6735, 0.3125, 0.039). 1. **Sketching the base:** - Draw a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the created coordinate system. - Create a closed loop with two circles. - The first circle has its center at (0.0235, 0.0235) and a radius of 0.0235. - The second circle has its center at (0.3485, 0.0235) and also has a radius of 0.0235. 2. **Extruding the sketch:** - Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.372. - Extrude the scaled sketch along its normal vector by a depth of 0.05.
