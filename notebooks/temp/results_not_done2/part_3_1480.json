Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Now, let's create the 2D sketch for this part. - Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. - Draw the first line from the point [0.0, 0.0] to the point [0.0187, 0.0]. - Draw the second line from the point [0.0187, 0.0] to the point [0.0187, 0.0187]. - Draw the third line from the point [0.0187, 0.0187] to the point [0.0, 0.0187]. - Draw the fourth line from the point [0.0, 0.0187] to the point [0.0, 0.0]. This completes the 2D sketch for the first part. There are two loops present in this sketch, with four lines each. Next, we'll scale and extrude the sketch to create a 3D model. - Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.0187 using the sketch_scale parameter. - Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. - Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the model with the following extrusion parameters: - Extrude depth towards the normal: 0.75 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 This is the first part of the assembly. Part 2: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.7312] Now, let's create the 2D sketch for this part. - Create a new sketch on the X-Z plane of the coordinate system. - Draw the first line from the point [0.0, 0.0] to the point [0.0187, 0.0188]. - Draw the second line from the point [0.0187, 0.0188] to the point [0.0, 0.0188]. - Draw the third line from the point [0.0, 0.0188] to the point [0.0, 0.0].
