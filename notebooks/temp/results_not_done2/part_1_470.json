The first intermediate CAD part is now complete. This part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The length and width are both 0.75 units, and the height is 0.75 units. The 2D sketch consists of four lines. Line 1 starts at [0.0, 0.0] and ends at [0.75, 0.0]. Line 2 starts at [0.75, 0.0] and ends at [0.75, 0.75]. Line 3 starts at [0.75, 0.75] and ends at [0.0, 0.75]. Line 4 starts at [0.0, 0.75] and ends at [0.0, 0.0], forming a closed loop. The 2D sketch is drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Each sketch can contain multiple faces, and each face can contain multiple loops. In this case, there is only one face, and it contains one loop. The loop consists of four lines, which are joined end-to-end to form a closed loop. Loops are always closed, and they can consist of multiple lines and/or arcs. However, they cannot consist of a line and a circle or an arc and a circle. The extrusion properties are as follows: extrude_depth_towards_normal = 0.75, extrude_depth_opposite_normal = 0.0, sketch_scale = 0.75, and the boolean operation for this part is to create a new solid body.
