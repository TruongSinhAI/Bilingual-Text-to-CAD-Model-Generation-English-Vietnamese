Create a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of this coordinate system. Step 2: Draw the Sketch Face 1 Loop 1 1. Draw a line from the point `[0.075, 0.0]` to the point `[0.675, 0.0]`. 2. Draw an arc from the point `[0.675, 0.0]` to the point `[0.675, 0.15]` with its midpoint at `[0.75, 0.075]`. 3. Draw a line from the point `[0.675, 0.15]` to the point `[0.075, 0.15]`. 4. Draw an arc from the point `[0.075, 0.15]` to the point `[0.075, 0.0]` with its midpoint at `[0.0, 0.075]`. Loop 2 1. Draw a circle with its center at `[0.075, 0.075]` and a radius of `0.03`. Loop 3 1. Draw a circle with its center at `[0.675, 0.075]` and a radius of `0.03`. Step 3: Transform the Sketch into a 3D Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of `0.75` and then transform it into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles and translation vector. Step 4: Extrude the Sketch Extrude the sketch by a depth of `0.05` towards the normal direction and a depth of `0` in the opposite direction. This will create a slightly tapered middle section in the cylindrical object. The final dimensions of the object are `0.75` in length, `0.05` in width, and `0.75` in height. Note: The two circles with radius `0.03` represent the holes in the top and bottom of the cylindrical object.</description>",
