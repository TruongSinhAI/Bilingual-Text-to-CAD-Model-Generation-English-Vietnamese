The JSON precisely reflects this with `face_1` through `face_4`, each containing a `loop_1` with the identical 8 lines described. This confirms the geometry generation. All coordinates match.\\n-- Extrusion: `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, and `sketch_scale` match the JSON. `CutFeatureOperation` matches the boolean operation described.\\n\\n- Correction: All inferred data points are consistent with the JSON structure and values.
