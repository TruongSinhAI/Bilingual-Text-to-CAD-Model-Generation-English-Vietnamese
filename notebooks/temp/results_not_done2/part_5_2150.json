Line 6: [0.1174, 0.2748] -> [0.0, 0.2033] The first line starts at the origin, and the last line ends at the origin, forming a closed loop. After drawing the sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.2748 using the sketch_scale parameter. Next, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model with an extrusion depth of 0.75 towards the opposite normal.

Next, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. This sketch will have one circle with the following properties: 1. Center: [0.1071, 0.1071] 2. Radius: 0.1071 After drawing the sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.2143 using the sketch_scale parameter. Next, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and translation vector of 0.0135, 0.0, 0.0303. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model with an extrusion depth of 0.75 towards the opposite normal. This will create a cylinder with a tapered top and bottom. Final Shape: A cylindrical object with a tapered end, resembling a funnel or a cone-shaped object with a narrower base. The final shape is achieved by combining parts 1 and 2. Start with part 1, which is a rectangular prism with a curved side. Perform a cut operation with part 2, which is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. The result is the final shape, which is a cylindrical object with a tapered end, resembling a funnel or a cone-shaped object with a narrower base.
