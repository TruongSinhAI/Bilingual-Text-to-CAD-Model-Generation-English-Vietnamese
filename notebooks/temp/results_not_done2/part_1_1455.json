Extrude the sketch in both normal and opposite normal directions with equal depth parameters (extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal=0.1091 and extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal=0.1091) to create a partially removed prism.\\n</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts:\\n- part_1: (Three-dimensional rectangular prism)\\n  - coordinate_system:\\n    - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\n    - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.4363, 0.0]\\n  - sketch:\\n    - face_1:\\n      - loop_1:\\n        - line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0]\\n        - line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.5868]\\n        - line_3: Start [0.75, 0.5868], End [0.0, 0.5868]\\n        - line_4: Start [0.0, 0.5868], End [0.0, 0.0]\\n  - extrusion:\\n    - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.4363\\n    - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (inferred from \"\n      , \"Extrude the sketch in the normal direction\"\n      , \")\\n    - sketch_scale: 0.75\\n    - operation: \"\n      , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n      , \" (from \"\n      , \"generate the 3D model\"\n      , \")\\n- part_2: (Rectangular prism)\\n  - coordinate_system:\\n    - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\n    - Translation Vector: [0.0433, 0.4363, 0.0445]\\n  - sketch:\\n    - face_1:\\n      - loop_1:\\n        - line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.6635, 0.0]\\n        - line_2: Start [0.6635, 0.0], End [0.6635, 0.4977]\\n        - line_3: Start [0.6635, 0.4977], End [0.0, 0.4977]\\n        - line_4: Start [0.0, 0.4977], End [0.0, 0.0]\\n  - extrusion:\\n    - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1091\\n    - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.1091\\n    - sketch_scale: 0.6635\\n    - operation: \"\n      , \"CutFeatureOperation\"\n      , \" (from \"\n      , \"create a partially removed prism\"\n      , \")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n- Check Part 1 components:\\n  - Coordinate system properties (Euler Angles and Translation Vector) match the JSON values.\\n  - Sketch loop lines (Start/End Points) are accurately transcribed and form a closed rectangle.\\n  - Extrusion parameters (\"\n      , \"extrude_depth_towards_normal\"\n      , \") match. \"\n      , \"extrude_depth_opposite_normal\"\n      , \" is correctly inferred as 0.0 since extrusion is only described \"\n      , \"in the normal direction\"\n      , \".\\n  - \"\n      , \"sketch_scale\"\n      , \" (0.75) matches.
