The sketch will be composed of three faces, which we'll call Face 1, Face 2, and Face 3. **Step 2.1: Face 1** Create a loop (Loop 1) on Face 1 with the following curves: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0652, 0.0], End Point [0.6196, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.6196, 0.0], End Point [0.6848, 0.0] * Arc 1: Start Point [0.6848, 0.0], Mid Point [0.7309, 0.0191], End Point [0.75, 0.0652] * Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.0652], End Point [0.75, 0.1924] * Arc 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.1924], Mid Point [0.6848, 0.2576], End Point [0.6196, 0.1924] * Line 4: Start Point [0.6196, 0.1924], End Point [0.6196, 0.163] * Arc 3: Start Point [0.6196, 0.163], Mid Point [0.61, 0.14], End Point [0.587, 0.1304] * Line 5: Start Point [0.587, 0.1304], End Point [0.0652, 0.1304] * Arc 4: Start Point [0.0652, 0.1304], Mid Point [0.0, 0.0652], End Point [0.0652, 0.0] Create two additional loops (Loop 2 and Loop 3) on Face 1, each containing one circle: * Loop 2: Circle 1, Center [0.0652, 0.0652], Radius 0.0408 * Loop 3: Circle 1, Center [0.6848, 0.1924], Radius 0.0408 **Step 2.2: Face 2** Create a loop (Loop 1) on Face 2 with one circle: * Circle 1: Center [0.0652, 0.0652], Radius 0.0163 **Step 2.3: Face 3** Create a loop (Loop 1) on Face 3 with one circle: * Circle 1: Center [0.6848, 0.1924], Radius 0.0163 **Step 3: Scale and transform the 2D sketch into 3D** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 and transform it into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.0815. **Summary:** The resulting CAD model will be a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole on one end. The length is 0.75 m, the width is 0.0815 m, and the height is 0.0815 m.</description>",
