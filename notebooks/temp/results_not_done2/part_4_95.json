The sloped side is at a 45 degree angle. After creating the sketch, scale it using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrude depth towards the normal should be 0.0937 units and the extrude depth opposite the normal should also be 0.0937 units. This will create a new solid body for the prism.
