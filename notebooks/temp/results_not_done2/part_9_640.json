Final Result The resulting part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is centered on a white background. There is a cylindrical object with a smaller cylindrical hole in its center. The larger cylinder is positioned above the smaller one, which is slightly offset to the left. The objects are centered in the image.</description>",
