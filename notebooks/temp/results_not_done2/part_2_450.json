Draw the first line from the point [0.0, 0.0] to the point [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Draw the second line from the point [0.75, 0.0] to the point [0.75, 0.375]. 3. Draw the third line from the point [0.75, 0.375] to the point [0.0, 0.375]. 4. Draw the fourth line from the point [0.0, 0.375] to the point [0.0, 0.0]. Step 3: Create the circular cutout on the base 1. Draw a circle with its center at [0.0423, 0.3385], and a radius of 0.0214. Step 4: Set the constraints for the loops 1. The first loop is a rectangle made up of 4 lines: line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, line\\\\_4. Loop is closed. 2. The second loop is a circle: circle\\\\_1. 3. Loop\\\\_1 and Loop\\\\_2 are on different faces of the base sketch. Step 5: Extrude the sketch Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with a depth of 0.03, and set the scale to 0.75. </description>\\n<valid>No</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description identifies a single \"\n            ,\"Part 1\",\n            \".\\n\\npart_1: (Rectangular Prism with cutout)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From description)\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.03, 0.0] (From description)\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1: (Rectangle)\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (From description)\\n----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.375] (From description)\\n----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.375], End [0.0, 0.375] (From description)\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.375], End [0.0, 0.0] (From description)\\n---loop_2: (Circle)\\n----circle_1: Center [0.0423, 0.3385], Radius 0.0214 (From description)\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.03 (From \"\n            ,\"Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with a depth of 0.03\",\n            \")\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred, as only towards normal is specified)\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (From \"\n            ,\"set the scale to 0.75\",\n            \")\\n--operation: \"\n            ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\",\n            \" (Inferred as it's creating the primary body)\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check the coordinate system:\\n  -Euler Angles and Translation Vector match the JSON precisely.\\n\\n-Check the sketch geometry:\\n  -loop_1 (rectangle) lines: All start/end points match the JSON.
