This will position the coordinate system for the part. **Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. **Step 3: Draw the outer boundary of the rectangular hole** Draw a line from the point (0.067, 0.0) to the point (0.683, 0.0).

The \"\n            ,\"sketch_scale\"\n            ,\" for Part 2 is also missing from the description. The structural description of the sketch (single face with multiple loops vs. multiple faces each with a loop) is also inconsistent.\\n</think>"
