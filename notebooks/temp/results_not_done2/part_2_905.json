However, the provided coordinates for `face_2` (e.g., `[0.0, 0.07]`, `[0.1649, 0.07]`, etc.) are clearly in X-Y format, not X-Z (which would be `[X, Z]`).

This explicitly limits scaling to `face_1` (the X-Y sketch). However, the `sketch_scale` in the JSON is at the `extrusion` level, which typically implies it applies to the entire composite sketch being extruded. If only `face_1` were scaled, the JSON structure should reflect that (e.g., a scale property within `face_1`). This is a mismatch in scope of the scaling factor.\\n-Check extrusion: `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.5413) and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0) match the description and standard assumptions. The `operation` is a standard inferred value.\\n\\n-Correction:\\nThe description states `face_2` is on the X-Z plane, but its coordinates are consistently X-Y. This is an inconsistency.\\nThe description implies `sketch_scale` applies only to `face_1`, while the JSON places it at the extrusion level, implying it applies to the combined sketch. This is also an inconsistency in scope.\\nDue to these inconsistencies, the description does not perfectly match the JSON.\\n</think>"
