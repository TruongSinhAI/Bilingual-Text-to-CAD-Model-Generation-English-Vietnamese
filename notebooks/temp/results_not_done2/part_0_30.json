The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The height of the prism is approximately twice the width. We will create this part in four steps: 1. Define the coordinate system 2. Draw the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane 3. Scale the 2D sketch 4. Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model Let's get started! **Step 1: Define the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0) with euler angles 0°, 0°, and 0° and translation vector (0, 0, 0). This will serve as the reference for our 2D sketch and the final 3D model. ```json \"coordinate_system\": { \"Euler Angles\": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ], \"Translation Vector\": [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] } ``` **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane** Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. Define a closed loop with four straight lines on the X-Y plane. The loop has four lines with start and end points as follows: * Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.7381, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point (0.7381, 0.0), End Point (0.7381, 0.75) * Line 3: Start Point (0.7381, 0.75), End Point (0.0, 0.75) * Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.75), End Point (0.0, 0.0) ```json \"sketch\": { \"face_1\": { \"loop_1\": { \"line_1\": { \"Start Point\": [ 0.0, 0.0 ], \"End Point\": [ 0.7381, 0.0 ] }, \"line_2\": { \"Start Point\": [ 0.7381, 0.0 ], \"End Point\": [ 0.7381, 0.75 ] }, \"line_3\": { \"Start Point\": [ 0.7381, 0.75 ], \"End Point\": [ 0.0, 0.75 ] }, \"line_4\": { \"Start Point\": [ 0.0, 0.75 ], \"End Point\": [ 0.0, 0.0 ] } } } } ``` **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the 2D sketch, which will scale down the sketch. ```json \"extrusion\": { \"sketch_scale\": 0.75, ... } ``` **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch in a depth of 0.2976 units in the direction of the normal and create a new 3D solid body. The final shape will have the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 units (3/4th of the original sketch) * Width: 0.75 units (3/4th of the original sketch) * Height: 0.2976 units (1/3rd of the width) The `operation` field in the JSON specifies creating a new body, which is implicit in extruding a sketch into a 3D model. ```json \"extrusion\": { \"extrude_depth_towards_normal\": 0.2976, \"operation\": \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" } ``` Congratulations! You have successfully constructed the first part as a rectangular prism. The junior CAD designer can follow these step-by-step instructions to generate the CAD model. The finished part has a scaling factor of 0.75, a height of 0.2976 units, and dimensions of 0.75 x 0.75 units. Continue building the remaining parts following the same structure and applying the respective scaling factors and extrusion depths.</description>",
