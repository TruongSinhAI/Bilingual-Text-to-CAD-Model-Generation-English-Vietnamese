The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.5 units and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0 units. The length and width of the part are 0.75 units and the height is 0.75 units, making the overall dimensions of the prism 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. This completes part 1. Final Shape: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides of the prism are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Since this is the final part, there are no further steps to follow.

This interpretation is supported by the overall context of constructing a multi-part object.\\n\\n--Result: All inferred components and values are consistent with the description and form logical CAD operations.
