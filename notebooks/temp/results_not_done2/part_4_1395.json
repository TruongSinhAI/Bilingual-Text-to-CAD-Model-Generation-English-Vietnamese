The JSON clearly specifies these as `0.0187`, `0.0`, `0.75`, and `\"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n    ,\"` respectively. This is a significant mismatch. - Part 2: - Coordinate System: Matches the JSON. - Sketch: The description states \"\n    ,\"Create four new sketches on the X-Y plane, X-Z plane, Y-Z plane, and X-Y plane respectively.\"\n    ,\" However, the JSON's `sketch` object for `part_2` contains `face_1`, `face_2`, `face_3`, `face_4`, each with a `loop_1` and a `circle_1`, and all circle coordinates are 2D (implying an XY plane definition within the coordinate system). This contradicts the description's mention of X-Z and Y-Z planes, and also the \"\n    ,\"four new sketches\"\n    ,\" phrasing versus four faces within one sketch. This is a mismatch. - The circle centers and radii match the JSON for the given faces. - Extrusion: The description only mentions \"\n    ,\"Operation: Cut\"\n    ,\". It *lacks* the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0), `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0375), and `sketch_scale` (0.6375) parameters found in the JSON. This is a significant mismatch. - Correction: Due to the missing extrusion details for Part 1, the incorrect plane descriptions for Part 2's sketch, and the missing extrusion depths/scale for Part 2, the overall validity is \"\n    ,\"No\"\n    ,\". </think>"
