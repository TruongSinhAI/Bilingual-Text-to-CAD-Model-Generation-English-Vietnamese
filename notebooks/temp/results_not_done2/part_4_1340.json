This forms a closed 0.75x0.75 square, which is a valid sketch for a rectangular prism.-Check Part 1 Extrusion:Extrusion depth towards normal is 0.6 and opposite is 0.0, with a sketch scale of 0.75 and operation \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n    ,\".

All values match the description and logically perform a cut operation.-Overall Consistency:All inferred parameters and values for both parts are consistent with the provided JSON data. No corrections are necessary. The description accurately reflects the CAD operations defined in the JSON. The mention of \"\n    ,\"Rectangular Prism with Rounded Corners\"\n    ,\" in Part 1's title is descriptive but the sketch itself defines a sharp-cornered rectangle, which is what the JSON reflects and is a common simplification in such descriptions if the \"\n    ,\"rounded corners\"\n    ,\" are an aesthetic detail or applied later. However, for the defined sketch, it's a standard rectangle. The JSON matches the specific numerical and geometric definitions given for lines and arcs. Hence, the description accurately describes the JSON's operations for each part. </think>"
