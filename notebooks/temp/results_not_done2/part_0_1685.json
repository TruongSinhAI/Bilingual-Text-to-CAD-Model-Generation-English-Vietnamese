This concludes the instructions for Part 1, which is a curved, hollow, metallic object with a smooth surface and a central hole. The length is approximately 0.75 units, the width is 0.09 units, and the height is also approximately 0.75 units. Note: Throughout these instructions, I avoid mentioning specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'. Instead, they are described as 'creating a new solid body'. The actual operation determination is left to the CAD software used for implementation.</description>",
