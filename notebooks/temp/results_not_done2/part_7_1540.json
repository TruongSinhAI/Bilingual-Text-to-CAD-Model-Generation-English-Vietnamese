It is symmetrical along its central axis. We will follow the standard process of creating an intermediate CAD part, consisting of steps to draw a 2D sketch, scale it, transform into 3D, and extrude to generate the 3D model. **Step 1: Draw a 2D sketch** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles as (0, 0, 0) and translation vector as (0, 0, 0). Our first face (face_1) in the sketch will be created on this coordinate system. **Step 1.1: Create loops for the face_1** Our face_1 will have two loops, loop_1 and loop_2. **Step 1.1.1: Create loop_1** loop_1 will be a circle with center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375 units. **Step 1.1.2: Create loop_2** loop_2 will also be a circle with the same center as loop_1 (0.375, 0.375) but with a smaller radius of 0.1714 units.

This will create a 3D model of the cylindrical object. As per the given JSON structure, the length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0536 units.
