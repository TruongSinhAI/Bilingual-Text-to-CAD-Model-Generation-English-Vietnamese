Correct.\\n--`extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is consistently inferred as 0.0, which is standard for single-direction extrusions. Correct.\\n--`operation` is consistently inferred as \"  ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"  ,\" for all parts, which is logical for creating distinct new bodies as described. Correct.\\n\\n-Correction: The inferred data is accurate and consistent with the JSON and description for all parts. No corrections needed.\\n</think>"
