Extrude Sketch Extrude the sketch by a distance of 0.163 along the opposite normal and a distance of 0.0 in the normal direction. Set the sketch scaling parameter to 0.163. This will cut the material from the previous part. The final shape of the assembly is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom, a smooth surface, and a uniform gray color.

Note that the height, width, and length of each part are defined in the context of the final shape, and the parts are constructed in sequence. The first part is the base part, and the second part is constructed on top of the first part. The boolean operation to combine the parts is not explicitly mentioned. Instead, it is inferred from the description of each part. For Part 1, the shape is described as \"A cylindrical object with a slightly tapered middle section and a flat top and bottom.\" This indicates that the part should be joined with the preceding CAD models to form a solid body. For Part 2, the shape is described as \"A cylindrical object with a tapered top and a flat bottom. The top is slightly wider than the bottom.\" This indicates that the part should cut or remove materials from the preceding CAD models. The final shape is a result of these operations. In summary, the instructions for each part include creating a coordinate system, drawing a 2D sketch, transforming the sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles and translation vector, and extruding the sketch to generate the 3D model. The final shape is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom, a smooth surface, and a uniform gray color.</description>",
