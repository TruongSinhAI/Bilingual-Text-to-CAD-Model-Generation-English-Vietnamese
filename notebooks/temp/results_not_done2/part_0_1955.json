The description suggests two separate faces, while the JSON groups both loops under a single `face_1`. This makes the JSON not fully consistent with the precise structural description. However, all numerical values for coordinates, scales, and extrusion depths are consistent. The primary inconsistency is the hierarchical representation of `face_2` as a distinct entity versus `loop_2` being nested within `face_1`. Given the specific wording \\\"The sketch contains two faces: face_1 and face_2. Face_1: - Loop_1... Face_2: - Loop_2...\\\", the JSON should ideally have two top-level faces.\\n</think>"
