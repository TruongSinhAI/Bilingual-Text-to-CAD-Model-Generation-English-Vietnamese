    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system for the base part. Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Sketching the 2D Profile Now, create a new sketch on the X-Y plane. 1. Draw the first line segment (line\\\\_1) with the start point at [0.0, 0.0] and the end point at [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Draw the second line segment (line\\\\_2) with the start point at [0.75, 0.0] and the end point at [0.75, 0.75]. 3. Draw the third line segment (line\\\\_3) with the start point at [0.75, 0.75] and the end point at [0.0, 0.75]. 4. Draw the fourth line segment (line\\\\_4) with the start point at [0.0, 0.75] and the end point at [0.0, 0.0]. Scaling the Sketch Scale the 2D sketch using the specified scaling parameter `sketch_scale` from the assembly JSON, which in this case is 0.75. Transforming and Extruding the 2D Profile Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch and rotate it by the euler angles defined in the coordinate system, which are [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. The translation vector for the coordinate system is also [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], so apply that as well. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. In this case, the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` is 0.75, and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is 0.0. Consequently, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.75 units.
