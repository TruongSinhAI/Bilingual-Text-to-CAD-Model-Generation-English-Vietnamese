    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0 for the x-axis, 0.0 for the y-axis, and -90.0 for the z-axis. Set the translation vector to 0.0 for the x-axis, 0.5 for the y-axis, and 0.0 for the z-axis. Proceed to create the sketch for this part. Focus on the first face of the sketch, which will be a flat plane with six straight lines. Start with the first line, which goes from 0.0 on the x-axis to 0.75 on the x-axis at the 0.0 y-value. The second line will start at 0.75 on the x-axis and move upward to 0.75 on the x-axis and 0.25 on the y-axis. Continue with the third line, which goes from 0.75 on the x-axis and 0.25 on the y-axis to 0.5 on the x-axis and 0.25 on the y-axis. Draw the fourth line from 0.5 on the x-axis and 0.25 on the y-axis up to 0.25 on the x-axis and 0.625 on the y-axis. The fifth line will travel leftward from 0.25 on the x-axis and 0.625 on the y-axis to 0.0 on the x-axis and 0.625 on the y-axis. To close the loop, draw the sixth line from 0.0 on the x-axis and 0.625 on the y-axis down to 0.0 on the x-axis and back to 0.0 on the y-axis. The sketch should now be complete. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by scaling it using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Apply the given Euler angles and translation vector during this transformation process. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal by 0.5 units, giving it a total height of 0.75. Consider this the first part of the CAD assembly. The part's dimensions, as determined from the VLM model, are as follows: - Shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.5 units - Height: 0.75 units</description>",
