    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Creating the Initial Rectangular Prism Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. Now, create a 2D sketch on a plane parallel to the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Define a face (face\\\\_1) and draw a rectangle by creating four lines: 1. line\\\\_1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0) 2. line\\\\_2: (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.75) 3. line\\\\_3: (0.75, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75) 4. line\\\\_4: (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.0) Close the loop to form a complete rectangle. Next, scale the 2D sketch using the scaling factor 0.75 and transform it into a 3D sketch. Following this, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis with an extrusion depth of 0.75 units. This will complete the construction of the first rectangular prism part, which has the following dimensions: - Height: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Length: 0.75 units Part 2: Creating the Cylindrical Cutout Now, create the cylindrical cutout on the existing rectangular prism. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the same euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0], but a different translation vector [0.25, 0.0, 0.25]. Now, create a 2D sketch on a plane parallel to the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Define another face (face\\\\_1) and draw a rectangle similar to what you did before: 1. line\\\\_1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.25, 0.0) 2. line\\\\_2: (0.25, 0.0) to (0.25, 0.25) 3. line\\\\_3: (0.25, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.25) 4. line\\\\_4: (0.0, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.0) Close the loop to form a complete rectangle. Instead of extrusion, we'll create a cut using the 'CutFeatureOperation'. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0 units, and the extrusion depth opposite the normal to 0.75 units. This will effectively create a cylindrical cutout along the Z-axis with a radius of 0.125 (1/8th of the original rectangle) and a height of 0.75 units. Although not explicitly stated, you can determine the dimensions of this part: - Height: 0.25 units - Width: 0.25 units - Length: 0.75 units</description>",
