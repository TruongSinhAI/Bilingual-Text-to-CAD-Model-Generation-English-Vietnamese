    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The prism is centered on the x-axis and is slightly offset from the y-axis. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 1 unit in height. The sloped side is at a 45-degree angle. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation and a translation vector of (0.1463, 0, 0). This will position the prism slightly to the right of the center line. Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane Create a new sketch on the XY plane. Draw a rectangle with a length of 0.6037 units and a width of 0.4024 units. The length corresponds to half the length of the final prism and the width corresponds to half the height of the prism. The rectangle should be centered at the origin. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.6037. This will result in a rectangle with a length of 0.3687 units and a width of 0.2417 units. The length corresponds to the final length of the prism and the width corresponds to the final height of the prism. Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by rotating it around the Z-axis by 45 degrees. This will result in a sloped side at a 45-degree angle. Step 5: Extrude the 3D sketch Extrude the 3D sketch by a distance of 0.1866 units in the positive Z-direction to create the prism. Part 2: Construct a smaller rectangular prism on top of the first prism. The smaller prism is centered on the x-axis and is slightly offset from the y-axis. The dimensions of the smaller prism are approximately 0.4 units in length, 0.4 units in width, and 0.05 units in height. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Create a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0). This will position the smaller prism directly on top of the first prism. Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane Create a new sketch on the XY plane. Draw a rectangle with a length of 0.1463 units and a width of 0.4024 units. The length corresponds to the width of the first prism and the width corresponds to the height of the smaller prism. The rectangle should be centered at the origin. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.4024. This will result in a rectangle with a length of 0.0586 units and a width of 0.1628 units. The length corresponds to the length of the smaller prism and the width corresponds to the height of the smaller prism. Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by translating it in the positive Z-direction by 0.4024 units. This will position the smaller prism on top of the first prism. Step 5: Extrude the 3D sketch Extrude the 3D sketch by a distance of 0.0549 units in the positive Z-direction to create the smaller prism. The smaller prism should be joined to the first prism.</description>",
