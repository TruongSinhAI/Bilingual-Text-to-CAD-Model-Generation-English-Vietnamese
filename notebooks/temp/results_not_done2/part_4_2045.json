    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with an Angled Front Face Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The sides of the prism are straight and meet at right angles. The object is centered in the image and has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.75 units * Height: 0.5 units Step 1: Create the coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch 1. Draw the first face of the prism, which is a rectangle, following these points: * Start Point [0.0, 0.0] * End Point [0.3125, 0.0] * End Point [0.3125, 0.375] * End Point [0.0, 0.375] * End Point [0.0, 0.0] 2. Draw the second face of the prism, which is also a rectangle, following these points: * Start Point [0.3125, 0.0] * End Point [0.75, 0.0] * End Point [0.75, 0.0625] * End Point [0.5, 0.0625] * End Point [0.5, 0.3125] * End Point [0.75, 0.3125] * End Point [0.75, 0.375] * End Point [0.3125, 0.375] * End Point [0.3125, 0.0] This completes the 2D sketch containing two faces, each having four lines. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75, which aligns the sketch to the desired dimensions of the final part. Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the current coordinate system. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the vector normal to the plane by a distance of 0.5 units. The \"operation\" property is set to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", which implies that the current part will be a new solid body as it combines with preceding CAD models. With these steps, you'll have successfully constructed Part 1 based on the provided CAD Assembly JSON.</description>",
