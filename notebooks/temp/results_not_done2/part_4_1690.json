The sketch consists of three faces: face\\\\_1, face\\\\_2, and face\\\\_3.

Loop\\\\_1 is the outer boundary of the rectangular prism, while loop\\\\_2 and loop\\\\_3 are the boundaries of the cylindrical holes. * Loop\\\\_1 starts at (0, 0.1935) and ends at (0.2708, 0.4211), and consists of arc\\\\_1, line\\\\_1, arc\\\\_2, line\\\\_2, arc\\\\_3, and line\\\\_3. Arc\\\\_1 starts at (0, 0.1935) and ends at (0.296, 0.0159), with a midpoint at (0.0851, 0). Arc\\\\_2 starts at (0.296, 0.0159) and ends at (0.609, 0.5107), with a midpoint at (0.7299, 0.4837).

Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.061 units, while the extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0.0 units.
