The geometry described by the points in the description is fundamentally different from the lines and arcs specified in the JSON for `face_1` `loop_1`. For example, JSON has 'arc_1' starting from (0.4243,0.1112) to (0.4756,0.1841) via (0.3806,0.1965), whereas the description lists (0.4243, 0.1112) followed by (0.5285, 0.1894), and (0.4756, 0.1841) is listed later, not as a mid-point or direct endpoint of a segment from the previous point.\\n- Check 'part_1' sketch definition for 'face_2':\\n  - The JSON defines `face_2` `loop_1` with 5 lines and 3 arcs.\\n  - The description for 'Face 2' defines a simple polyline using 8 points, implying 7 line segments and closing the loop (8 segments total). Similar to face_1, the detailed line and arc definitions in the JSON do not match the simple polyline point list in the description.\\n\\n- Overall sketch mismatch:\\n  - The description provides lists of polyline points, which do not translate directly to the specific sequence of lines and arcs (with midpoints for arcs) defined in the JSON. The number and type of geometric entities (lines vs. arcs) for each face's loop do not correspond between the description and the JSON.\\n\\n- Correction: The description's representation of the sketch geometry is significantly different and less detailed than what is present in the JSON. The JSON details specific lines and arcs with their start/mid/end points, which is not captured by the polyline point lists in the description. Therefore, the description does not accurately match the JSON's sketch details.\\n</think>"

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with Angled Front Face Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. The euler angles are 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and the translation vector is 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. This will place the coordinate system at the origin of the global coordinate system. Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch Create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch consists of one face (face_1). Step 3: Create the loops face_1 contains one loop (loop_1) consisting of 4 lines. * Loop_1, Line_1: Start Point = (0.0, 0.0), End Point = (0.6818, 0.0) * Loop_1, Line_2: Start Point = (0.6818, 0.0), End Point = (0.6818, 0.75) * Loop_1, Line_3: Start Point = (0.6818, 0.75), End Point = (0.0, 0.75) * Loop_1, Line_4: Start Point = (0.0, 0.75), End Point = (0.0, 0.0) Note that the start point of Line_1 and the end point of Line_4 coincide, closing the loop and forming a face in 3D space. Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 based on sketch_scale parameter. This is necessary since the final dimensions of the part would have a width and length of 0.75 units. The height remains unchanged because the depth of extrusion defines it. Step 5: Extrude the scaled sketch Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.0034 units, which is the height of the final part. By doing this, you will generate the 3D model for part 1. Final Shape and Dimensions The final shape is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The front face is angled at 45 degrees from the top and bottom faces. The object is centered on a white background with the following dimensions: * Length = 0.75 units * Width = 0.75 units * Height = 0.0034 units</description>",
