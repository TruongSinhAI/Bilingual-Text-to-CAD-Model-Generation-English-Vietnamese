    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is centered on a white background. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees in that order. This will create a coordinate system that is rotated -90.0 degrees around the Z-axis. Set the translation vector to 0.0, 0.3252, 0.0. This will move the origin to a position 0.3252 units above the XY plane. Next, create the 2D sketch for this part. The sketch should be created on a plane defined by the XY coordinate system. The sketch consists of multiple faces, faces 1, and contains a single loop, loop 1. Loop 1 in face 1 contains 4 lines and 1 arc. Here are the details of each curve: 1. Line 1: Start point (0.0, 0.0), end point (0.6989, 0.0) 2. Line 2: Start point (0.6989, 0.0), end point (0.6989, 0.75) 3. Line 3: Start point (0.6989, 0.75), end point (0.3252, 0.75) 4.

    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is centered on a white background. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees in that order. This will create a coordinate system that is rotated -90.0 degrees around the Z-axis. Set the translation vector to 0.0, 0.3252, 0.0. This will move the origin to a position 0.3252 units above the XY plane. Next, create the 2D sketch for this part. The sketch should be created on a plane defined by the XY coordinate system. The sketch consists of multiple faces, faces 1, and contains a single loop, loop 1. Loop 1 in face 1 contains 4 lines and 1 arc. Here are the details of each curve: 1. Line 1: Start point (0.0, 0.0), end point (0.6989, 0.0) 2.
