If it were a straight line between those two points, its mid-point would not be [0.0522, 0.0522].

The description refers to it as \\\"Line 1\\\", while the JSON defines it as \\\"arc_1\\\" with a mid-point, indicating it is indeed an arc and not a straight line. This fundamental difference in geometry makes the description not fully match the JSON.\\n</think>"
