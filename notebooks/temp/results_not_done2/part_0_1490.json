This will serve as the origin for our metal bracket. Next, let's create the 2D sketch for the bracket. The sketch consists of three faces - face 1, face 2, and face 3. For this example, we'll focus on face 1. Face 1 contains three loops - loop 1, loop 2, and loop 3. Loop 1 is a rectangular shape formed by four arcs. Here are the details: * Arc 1: Start Point (0.1749, 0.0), Mid Point (0.375, 0.0303), End Point (0.5751, 0.0) * Arc 2: Start Point (0.5751, 0.0), Mid Point (0.75, 0.1289), End Point (0.5751, 0.2577) * Arc 3: Start Point (0.5751, 0.2577), Mid Point (0.375, 0.2274), End Point (0.1749, 0.2577) * Arc 4: Start Point (0.1749, 0.2577), Mid Point (0.0, 0.1289), End Point (0.1749, 0.0) Loops 2 and 3 are circular shapes, each with a radius of 0.059. Loop 2 is centered at (0.1349, 0.1289) and Loop 3 is centered at (0.6151, 0.1289). After creating the 2D sketch, we can scale it using a scaling parameter of 0.75 and transform it into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. Finally, we can extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.0337 towards the normal direction and 0.0 in the opposite direction. This will create the 3D model for Part 1 of the CAD assembly. According to the description, the shape of Part 1 is a rectangular metal bracket with two holes on opposite sides, with a length and width of 0.75 and a height of 0.0337. When combined with subsequent parts, this will form the final CAD model. Providing only the instructions, the shape and dimensions of the final CAD model are determined entirely by the JSON data.</description>",
