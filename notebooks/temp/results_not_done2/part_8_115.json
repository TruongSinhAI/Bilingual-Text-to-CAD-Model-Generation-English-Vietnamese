    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A Curved Rectangular Prism** The first part of the CAD model is a curved rectangular prism. It has three faces - the top face, the bottom face, and the curved face. The top and bottom faces are each made up of one loop, while the curved face is made up of two loops. *Top Face* 1. Create a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of [0, 0, 0]. 2. Draw a sketch on the X-Y plane. 3. Create a loop with one line that goes from (0.075, 0) to (0.675, 0). 4. Close the loop. *Bottom Face* 5. This face is identical to the top face, but translated down by 0.075 units. *Curved Face* 6. Create a new loop with an arc that goes from (0.675, 0) to (0.675, 0.15) with a midpoint at (0.75, 0.075). 7. Create another arc that goes from (0.675, 0.15) to (0.075, 0.15) with a midpoint at (0.0, 0.075). 8. Create a final arc that goes from (0.075, 0.15) to (0.075, 0) with a midpoint at (0.0375, 0.075). 9. Close the loop. 10. Create a second loop with a circle centered at (0.075, 0.075) with a radius of 0.0375. 11. Create a third loop with a circle centered at (0.675, 0.075) with a radius of 0.0375. After all the loops have been created, scale the sketch by 0.75. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. For this transformation, use the same coordinate system as before (no rotation and a translation vector of [0, 0, 0]). Finally, extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.075 units along the normal vector and a depth of 0 units in the opposite direction. This completes the construction of the first part. The length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.075 units.</description>",
