Start by creating a new face on the XY plane. 2. Draw line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.4598, 0.0] 3. Draw line 2: Start Point [0.4598, 0.0], End Point [0.4598, 0.75] 4. Draw line 3: Start Point [0.4598, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] 5. Draw line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Constraints to follow: * A Loop is always closed. * Loop_1 consists of 4 lines. * Loop_1 is the only loop (as each sketch can contain multiple faces, which can contain multiple loops, but in this case, there is only one loop). Next, let's scale the sketch: Scale the entire 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by performing the following translation and rotation: * Rotation: Euler Angles will remain the same (Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]) * Translation: Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.4004, 0.0] Now, let's extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model: * Extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.4004 * Extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 * Sketch_scale: 0.75 * Operation: Create a new solid body. The 3D model will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The length is 0.75, width is 0.4004, and height is 0.75.</description>",
