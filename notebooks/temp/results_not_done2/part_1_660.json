    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners and edges** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] Next, create the sketch for the first face of the part. This face will consist of multiple loops, which in turn will consist of lines and circles. Here's the breakdown of the curves and loops for the first face: * **Line 1**: Start Point: [0.0, 0.0], End Point: [0.2308, 0.0] * **Line 2**: Start Point: [0.2308, 0.0], End Point: [0.2308, 0.75] * **Line 3**: Start Point: [0.2308, 0.75], End Point: [0.0, 0.75] * **Line 4**: Start Point: [0.0, 0.75], End Point: [0.0, 0.6346] * **Line 5**: Start Point: [0.0, 0.6346], End Point: [0.0, 0.1154] * **Line 6**: Start Point: [0.0, 0.1154], End Point: [0.0, 0.0] Loops must be closed, hence, the last point of each line segment should be the same as the starting point for the next line segment. This first loop consists of 6 line segments and forms the top edge of the prism. The second loop consists of a circle in the middle of the first loop's edge: * **Circle 1**: Center: [0.1154, 0.1154], Radius: 0.0375 The third loop also consists of a circle, but at the opposite edge of the prism's edge: * **Circle 2**: Center: [0.1154, 0.6346], Radius: 0.0375 After defining the sketch, Isolate the first face and create the second face using the same vertices but in the opposite direction. Repeat the same Curves and Loops generation process as for the first face, with the exception of having three loops. For the second face's loops: * The first loop is similar to the first loop of the first face, but clockwise instead of counterclockwise. * The second loop is the same as the third loop of the first face (Circle 1). * The third loop is the same as the second loop of the first face (Circle 2). Now you have the 2D sketches for both faces. Proceed to scale the sketches using a scaling parameter of 0.75 and then transform the scaled 2D sketches into 3D Sketches using the euler angles and translation vector obtained from the \"coordinate_system\" definition. Next, extrude both the 2D sketches using the following properties: * Extrude depth towards normal: 0.75 (for both) * Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 (for both) * Sketch scale: 0.75 (for both) * Operation: Creation of new bodies (for both) The completed part should now form a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners and edges, having a length, width, and height of 0.75 units. Once you complete part 1, provide the same detailed step-by-step instructions for the subsequent parts, ensuring that you adjust the applicable coordinates as necessary to reflect the correct dimensions outlined in the provided JSON for each part.</description>",

    "reasoning": "<description>**Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners and edges** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] Next, create the sketch for the first face of the part. This face will consist of multiple loops, which in turn will consist of lines and circles. Here's the breakdown of the curves and loops for the first face: * **Line 1**: Start Point: [0.0, 0.0], End Point: [0.2308, 0.0] * **Line 2**: Start Point: [0.2308, 0.0], End Point: [0.2308, 0.75] * **Line 3**: Start Point: [0.2308, 0.75], End Point: [0.0, 0.75] * **Line 4**: Start Point: [0.0, 0.75], End Point: [0.0, 0.6346] * **Line 5**: Start Point: [0.0, 0.6346], End Point: [0.0, 0.1154] * **Line 6**: Start Point: [0.0, 0.1154], End Point: [0.0, 0.0] Loops must be closed, hence, the last point of each line segment should be the same as the starting point for the next line segment. This first loop consists of 6 line segments and forms the top edge of the prism. The second loop consists of a circle in the middle of the first loop's edge: * **Circle 1**: Center: [0.1154, 0.1154], Radius: 0.0375 The third loop also consists of a circle, but at the opposite edge of the prism's edge: * **Circle 2**: Center: [0.1154, 0.6346], Radius: 0.0375 After defining the sketch, Isolate the first face and create the second face using the same vertices but in the opposite direction. Repeat the same Curves and Loops generation process as for the first face, with the exception of having three loops. For the second face's loops: * The first loop is similar to the first loop of the first face, but clockwise instead of counterclockwise. * The second loop is the same as the third loop of the first face (Circle 1). * The third loop is the same as the second loop of the first face (Circle 2). Now you have the 2D sketches for both faces. Proceed to scale the sketches using a scaling parameter of 0.75 and then transform the scaled 2D sketches into 3D Sketches using the euler angles and translation vector obtained from the \" ,\"coordinate_system\" ,\" definition.
