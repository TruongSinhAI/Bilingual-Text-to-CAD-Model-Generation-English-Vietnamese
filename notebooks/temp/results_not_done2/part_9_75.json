This creates the base part for the final CAD model. The length, width, and height of this part are 0.75, 0.75, and 0.0267, respectively. Add the part to the final CAD model using an additive (join) boolean operation. After completing these steps, move on to the next part. Having a proper organization and sequence in creating parts and following the final CAD shape will lead to an accurate design.</description>",
