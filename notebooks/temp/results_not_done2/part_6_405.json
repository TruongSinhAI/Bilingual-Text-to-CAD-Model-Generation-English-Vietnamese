Step 4: Extrude the Sketch Extrude the 3D sketch along the Z-axis (or the normal direction) by 0.3 units, while keeping the original sketch width and height as described in the JSON file (Width: 0.3, Height: 0.75). This will create the desired 3D shape, adding the new body as a part of the assembly. Final Shape Details The final shape will be a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom. The top and bottom edges will be rounded, and the sides will be straight.
