Step 2: Create the 2D Sketch 1. Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a circle centered at [0.375, 0.375] with a radius of 0.375. Label this circle 'circle\\\\_1'. Step 3: Transform the 2D Sketch into a 3D Sketch 1. Set the scaling parameter for the sketch to 0.75. 2. Define the euler angles as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], and set the translation vector as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 3. Transform the 2D sketch using these Euler angles and translation vector. Step 4: Extrude the Sketch to Create the 3D Model 1. Extrude the 2D sketch in a direction normal to the sketch by 0.0144 units. 2. Extrude the skirt in the opposite direction of the normal by 0 units. 3. The resulting height of the cylindrical object is 0.0144 units. Part 2: Nested Cylindrical Object with a Slightly Tapered Top and Bottom Step 1: Create the Coordinate System 1. Create a new coordinate system with no rotation (euler angles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]). 2. Set the translation vector as [0.1082, 0.1082, 0.0144]. Step 2: Create the 2D Sketch 1. Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a circle centered at [0.2668, 0.2668] with a radius of 0.2668. Label this circle 'circle\\\\_1'. Step 3: Transform the 2D Sketch into a 3D Sketch 1. Set the scaling parameter for the sketch to 0.5337. 2. Define the euler angles as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and set the translation vector as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 3. Transform the 2D sketch using these Euler angles and translation vector. Step 4: Extrude the Sketch to Create the 3D Model 1. Extrude the 2D sketch in a direction normal to the sketch by 0.0 units. 2. Extrude the skirt in the opposite direction of the normal by 0.7212 units. The nested cylindrical object has a 'CutFeatureOperation' applied to it, effectively cutting it relative to the previous part. The length and width of this nested object are the same, at approximately 0.5337 units, while its height is 0.7212 units. The overall model consists of a simple, hollow, circular object with a smooth, curved surface. The final shape has a diameter of approximately 0.75 units and a height of approximately 0.7356 units.</description>",
