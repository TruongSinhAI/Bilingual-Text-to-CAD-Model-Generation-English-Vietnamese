Set the euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees, respectively. For the translation vector, use the values 0.0, 0.4581, and 0.0. Step 2: Sketch Create a new sketch using the defined coordinate system. Step 3: Loops and Faces We will create one face with a single loop. This loop will be composed of nine line segments. 1. Line 1: connect the points (0.0, 0.0007) and (0.0007, 0.0) 2. Line 2: connect (0.0007, 0.0) and (0.1258, 0.1251) 3. Line 3: connect (0.1258, 0.1251) and (0.6241, 0.1251) 4.

The extrude depth should be 0.4581 units, and the opposite normal direction depth set to 0. Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch during the extrusion operation.

Now, transform the 2D sketch into 3D using a scale of 0.75, a rotation of 0 degrees around all axes, and a translation of (0, 0, 0). Extrude the sketch along the normal axis with a depth of 0.5 units, resulting in a new solid body. Part 2 - Rectangular prism with a flat top, bottom, and a curved side Create a new coordinate system with rotation angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of (0.0625, 0.0625, 0.5). Create the second sketch on the X-Y plane with the following lines: * Line 1: Start point (0,0), end point (0.625, 0) * Line 2: Start point (0.625, 0), end point (0.625, 0.3125) * Line 3: Start point (0.625, 0.3125), end point (0, 0.3125) * Line 4: Start point (0, 0.3125), end point (0, 0) The sketch features one rectangular face (face_1) with one loop (loop_1) and four lines (line_1 to line_4). Now, transform the 2D sketch into 3D using a scale of 0.625, a rotation of 0 degrees around all axes, and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0). Extrude the sketch along the opposite normal direction with a depth of 0.25 units, subtracting from the existing solid body to create a curved side. To be clear, the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` values represent the extrusion depths along the normal and opposite normal directions for each sketch relative to the preceding part or for the first part, relative to the origin. The `sketch_scale` parameter is used to scale each sketch before extrusion. The operations for the later parts depend on your desired result for the final CAD assembly. The final shape will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face, considering the translations of each part. The front face will be the only one not parallel to the top or bottom faces. Note that the designer should use the `final_shape` information provided in the JSON to position and align each part appropriately in order to achieve the desired appearance on a white background.</description>",
