This part is positioned at an angle, with the hole facing upwards. The prism is slightly tapered as well, with the wider end at the bottom. **Step 1: Creating the Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.2104, 0.2652, 0.0] **Step 2: Drawing the Sketch** Next, create a sketch on the X-Y plane of the newly defined coordinate system. Draw the following lines and circles to form the profile of the prism and the cylindrical hole: * Line 1: From (0.0, 0.0) to (0.3293, 0.0) * Line 2: From (0.3293, 0.0) to (0.3293, 0.0915) * Line 3: From (0.3293, 0.0915) to (0.3293, 0.6402) * Line 4: From (0.3293, 0.6402) to (0.3293, 0.7317) * Line 5: From (0.3293, 0.7317) to (0.0, 0.7317) * Line 6: From (0.0, 0.7317) to (0.0, 0.6402) * Line 7: From (0.0, 0.6402) to (0.0, 0.0915) * Line 8: From (0.0, 0.0915) to (0.0, 0.0) * Circle 1: With center at (0.1646, 0.3659) and radius of 0.1372 **Step 3: Scaling the Sketch** Now, scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.7317. **Step 4: Extruding the Sketch** Finally, extrude the sketch in the normal direction by 0.2652 and in the opposite direction by 0. This will create the first part, which is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The dimensions of this part are as follows: * Length: 0.7317 * Width: 0.2652 * Height: 0.7317</description>",
