Also, the description provides explicit details for only *one* loop_1 of arcs, implying it's the face_1's loop_1, but the JSON shows other faces like face_2 also have loop_1 with arcs.

The phrasing \\\"Create face\\\\_2, face\\\\_3, face\\\\_4, face\\\\_5, face\\\\_6, and face\\\\_7 in a similar manner, following the provided JSON data\\\" acts as a placeholder for the explicit details needed to fully define the sketch from the description alone.
