Start by drawing a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.0). 4. Continue with a line from (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.1875). 5. Draw the next line from (0.75, 0.1875) to (0.4063, 0.1875). 6. Then, draw a line from (0.4063, 0.1875) to (0.375, 0.25). 7. Continue by drawing a line from (0.375, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.25). 8. Draw a line from (0.25, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.1875). 9. Then, draw a line from (0.25, 0.1875) to (0.3125, 0.1875). 10. Continue with a line from (0.3125, 0.1875) to (0.3125, 0.125). 11. Draw the next line from (0.3125, 0.125) to (0.0625, 0.125). 12. Then, draw a line from (0.0625, 0.125) to (0.0625, 0.1875). 13. Continue with a line from (0.0625, 0.1875) to (0.125, 0.1875). 14. Draw a line from (0.125, 0.1875) to (0.125, 0.25). 15. Finally, draw a line from (0.125, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.25). 16. Close the loop by drawing a line from (0.0, 0.25) back to (0.0, 0.0). **Extrusion and Completion:** 1.

Create a new face (face_1) and draw the first line (line_1) with a start point of [0.0, 0.0] and an end point of [0.6, 0.0]. b. Continue drawing lines on the same face, ensuring that the next line (line_2) starts where the previous one ended ([0.6, 0.0]) and ends at ([0.6, 0.75]). c. Repeat the process for subsequent lines on the same face. Use [0.6, 0.75] as the starting point for line_3 and end it at [0.45, 0.75]. d. Continue using the end point of the previous line as the starting point for the next line, until you have completed all lines. 2. Extrusion: a. Scale the sketch using a scale factor of 0.75. b.
