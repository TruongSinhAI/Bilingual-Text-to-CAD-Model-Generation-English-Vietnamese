Part 2: A Cylindrical Object with a Tapered Top and Bottom Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0196, 0.1067, 0.0267] Next, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane.

The final shape will be a combination of Part 1 and Part 2. The cylindrical object (Part 2) is positioned inside the rectangular prism (Part 1) after joining the two parts together, and the final assembly resembles a cylindrical object with a rectangular hole in the center, tilted slightly to the right.
