    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism** The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The prism's dimensions are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. 1. **Create a new coordinate system**: Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.1351, 0.0]. 2. **Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane**: a. Draw line 1 from the point (0.0, 0.1936) to the point (0.3213, 0.0). b. Draw line 2 from the point (0.3213, 0.0) to the point (0.6495, 0.1814). c. Draw line 3 from the point (0.6495, 0.1814) to the point (0.6565, 0.5564). d. Draw line 4 from the point (0.6565, 0.5564) to the point (0.3353, 0.75). e. Draw line 5 from the point (0.3353, 0.75) to the point (0.007, 0.5686). f. Draw line 6 from the point (0.007, 0.5686) to the point (0.0, 0.1936). 3. **Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75**: This scaling makes the prism's final dimensions 1.5 units by 3 units by 4.5 units in the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch**: Set the transformation by orienting the sketch's normal vector upwards with a positive Z-component, using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch to create the final 3D prism**: Set the extrude depth towards the normal vector to 0.1351 units and without opposite normal extrusion. The scaling factor remains 0.75 from step 3. The prism should join with preceding CAD models, adding material. The resulting prism should have the following dimensions: - **Length**: 0.75 units - **Width**: 0.1351 units - **Height**: 0.75 units This concludes the CAD operations for the first part. Move on to create subsequent parts, as required by the assembly JSON, following similar steps but tailored to their unique design requirements. Keep the instructions concise and clear, focusing on the immediate operations to construct the desired shapes.</description>",

    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom** The first part is a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. It has a slightly tapered shape, narrowing slightly towards the top. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles are set to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is set to [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. This will position the prism at the correct location and orientation. Next, create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch will be a rectangle with the following dimensions: - line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.0333, 0.0) - line 2: Start Point (0.0333, 0.0), End Point (0.0333, 0.0333) - line 3: Start Point (0.0333, 0.0333), End Point (0.0, 0.0333) - line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.0333), End Point (0.0, 0.0) The sketch contains four lines arranged in a closed loop, forming a rectangle. After creating the 2D sketch, scale it using the scaling parameter `sketch_scale` with a value of 0.0333. This will adjust the size of the rectangle to the desired dimensions. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model of the prism. Set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.75, and the extrude depth opposite normal to 0.0. This will make the prism slightly tapered towards the top, as described in the final shape. The sketch scale should be set to 0.0333, the same value used in the 2D sketch scaling step.
