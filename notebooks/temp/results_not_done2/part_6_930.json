Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to generate the 3D model for the base. Use the following extrusion parameters: * Extrude depth towards normal: 0.017 * Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 * Sketch scale: 0.75 * Operation: Create a new solid body The dimensions of the intermediate part are approximately 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height, with a hole of about 0.5 units in diameter. Continue with these instructions for the remaining parts of the CAD assembly JSON, ensuring to create new coordinate systems for each part, using the provided JSON data to construct the respective 2D sketches, and scaling and transforming them into 3D models using the given parameters and operation types. Make sure to provide clear instructions for each loop and curve in every part, and describe their shapes and relations to other loops and curves in the part. Also, mention the height, width, and length measurements for each part.</description>",
