Additionally, create a third concentric circle indicated as circle\\\\_3 with these properties: * Circle 3: + Center: [0.375, 0.375] + Radius: 0.2757 And incorporate this into face\\\\_1 as well. The object we are creating is cylindrical with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The concentric circles help ensure proper scaling when creating the 3D model from this 2D sketch. Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the `sketch_scale` parameter.
