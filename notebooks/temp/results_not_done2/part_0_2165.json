Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.0064 towards the normal and a depth of 0.0 opposite the normal. Set the sketch scale to 0.75. Part 2: Construct a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0, 0, 180 degrees and a translation vector of 0, 0.2571, 0.0429. Create the first face of the sketch with the following loop: 1. Line 1: Start point (0, 0), end point (0.0107, 0) 2. Line 2: Start point (0.0107, 0), end point (0.0107, 0.2571) 3. Line 3: Start point (0.0107, 0.2571), end point (0, 0.2571) 4. Line 4: Start point (0, 0.2571), end point (0, 0) Create the second face of the sketch with the following loop: 1. Line 1: Start point (0.7393, 0), end point (0.75, 0) 2. Line 2: Start point (0.75, 0), end point (0.75, 0.2571) 3. Line 3: Start point (0.75, 0.2571), end point (0.7393, 0.2571) 4. Line 4: Start point (0.7393, 0.2571), end point (0.7393, 0) The above two loops forms 2 closed loops, each of which consists of 4 straight lines. Scale the 2D sketch with a scaling factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using a euler angle rotation of 0, 0, 180 degrees and a translation vector of 0, 0.2571, 0.0429.
