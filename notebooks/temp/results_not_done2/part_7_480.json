Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.1243, 0.0, 0.0854]. Create four 2D sketches on faces 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the coordinate system. 1.

Close the loops in each sketch. Do not scale the 2D sketches. Transform the 2D sketches into 3D sketches using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system.
