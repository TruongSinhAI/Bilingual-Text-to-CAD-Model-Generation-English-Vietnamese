Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] with no rotation. **Face 1:** Create the first face by sketching a circle on the XY plane with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375 units. This circle corresponds to **loop\\\\_1** and **circle\\\\_1**. Create the second loop on the same face by sketching another circle on the XY plane with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.1364 units. This circle corresponds to **loop\\\\_2** and **circle\\\\_1**. **Extrusion:** Extrude the first face along the Z-axis by 0.0545 units towards the positive normal direction. No extrusion should occur in the opposite direction of the normals. Scale the sketch by 0.75. The boolean operation is to create a new solid body. **Description:** The part's shape is a cylindrical object with a central hole, with a length of 0.75 units, width of 0.75 units, and height of 0.0545 units. **Part 2: Inner Cylindrical Ring** Create an inner cylindrical ring to fit into the central hole of the previous part. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0.2114, 0.2114, 0.0545) with no rotation. **Face 1:** Create the first face by sketching a circle on the XY plane with a center at (0.1636, 0.1636) and a radius of 0.1636 units. This circle corresponds to **loop\\\\_1** and **circle\\\\_1**. Create the second loop on the same face by sketching another circle on the XY plane with a center at (0.1636, 0.1636) and a radius of 0.1364 units. This circle corresponds to **loop\\\\_2** and **circle\\\\_1**. **Extrusion:** Extrude the first face along the Z-axis by 0.0368 units in the opposite direction of the normals. Scale the sketch by 0.3273. The boolean operation is to remove or cut away part of the existing body. **Description:** The part's shape is a 3D model of a ring with a hollow center, composed of multiple concentric circles. The inner circle is smaller than the outer circle, creating a hollow space in the center. The ring has a simple, yet elegant design and is symmetrical. The part has a length of 0.3273 units, width of 0.3273 units, and height of 0.0368 units. Please ensure the new coordinate system is placed appropriately to properly position this inner ring part within Part 1.</description>",
