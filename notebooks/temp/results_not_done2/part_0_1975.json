This implies a single arc passing through four points, which is geometrically impossible for a standard arc. More importantly, the JSON's `loop_2` clearly defines four *lines* forming a rectangle with these exact points as vertices (`line_1` to `line_4`). This is a fundamental **mismatch** in geometry type (arc vs. lines) and shape definition. The description's overall title \"\n                ,\"Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Curved Side\"\n                ,\" is also misleading, as the inner sketch creates a rectangular cutout, not a curved side of the main prism.

(Correct)\\n--Part 2 is consistent with the JSON.\\n\\n-Correction: The description for Part 1, particularly for `loop_2`, must be corrected. It should specify that `loop_2` is formed by four lines creating a rectangle, not a single arc. The general description of the part should also be updated to reflect a rectangular prism with a rectangular cutout, not a \"\n                ,\"curved side\"\n                ,\".\\n</think>"
