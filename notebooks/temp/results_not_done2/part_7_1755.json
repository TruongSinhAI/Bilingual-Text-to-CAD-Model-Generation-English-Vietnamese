Create a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw a line from the origin (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.75, 0.0). Draw a line from the point (0.75, 0.0) to the point (0.75, 0.0625). Draw a line from the point (0.75, 0.0625) to the point (0.5938, 0.0625). Draw a line from the point (0.5938, 0.0625) to the point (0.5938, 0.2188). Draw a line from the point (0.5938, 0.2188) to the point (0.5312, 0.2188). Draw an arc from the point (0.5312, 0.2188) to the point (0.2188, 0.2188) with a midpoint at (0.375, 0.0625). Draw a line from the point (0.2188, 0.2188) to the point (0.1562, 0.2188). Draw a line from the point (0.1562, 0.2188) to the point (0.1562, 0.0625). Draw a line from the point (0.1562, 0.0625) to the point (0.0, 0.0625). Close the loop and dimension the sketch as necessary. The sketch should have a length of 0.2812, a width of 0.75, and a height of 0.75. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the sketch in the positive Z direction by a depth of 0.2812. **Part 2: Cut a cylindrical hole in the center of the prism** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.1081, 0.0404, 0.0625]. Create a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw a circle with a center point at (0.0312, 0.0313) and a radius of 0.0312. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6601. Transform the scaled sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Cut the sketch with an extrusion depth of 0.0625 in the negative Z direction. The final CAD model will be a rectangular metal bracket with a circular hole in the center. The bracket will have a length of 0.2812 and a width of 0.75. The circular hole will have a diameter of 0.0624 (or a radius of 0.0312) and a height of 0.0625. The bracket will be centered on the origin of the coordinate system, with the hole located at (0.1081, 0.0404, 0.0925) in the positive X and Y directions and the negative Z direction, respectively.</description>",
