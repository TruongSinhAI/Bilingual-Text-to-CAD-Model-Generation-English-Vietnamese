    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Large Circular Metallic Ring with a Central Hole Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Create a new coordinate system with the Euler Angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector [0.2942, 0.0002, 0.0]. Step 2: Create the base 2D sketch Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system. Step 3: Draw the loops for the outer and inner circles Draw the first loop consisting of: * A line from point (0.0, 0.741) to point (0.0271, 0.618). * An arc from point (0.0271, 0.618) to point (0.1176, 0.6211) with its midpoint at (0.0894, 0.1259). * A line from point (0.1176, 0.6211) to point (0.1361, 0.7457). * An arc from point (0.1361, 0.7457) to point (0.0, 0.741) with its midpoint at (0.0937, 0.0). Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch uniformly with a scaling factor of 0.7457. Step 5: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the rotation specified by the Euler angles and the translation vector from the coordinate system. Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.082 units. The resulting 3D model should have a height of 0.082 units, maintaining the overall dimensions of the original 2D sketch. This will result in a large, circular, metallic ring with a smaller, circular, metallic hole in the center. Part 2: Additional Instructions for Subsequent Parts Please follow a similar process for subsequent parts, starting with creating a new coordinate system and then proceeding through sketching, scaling, transforming, and extruding as necessary. Remember to extrude or cut features based on the `operation` property, making sure to add or remove material as required without explicitly naming the operation. Always use clear and concise language, and organize each part's instructions with headings and section breaks, mentioning the number of curves if a loop has many curves. Please refer to the given CAD Assembly JSON for specific dimensions and parameters of each part, and follow the constraints and rules mentioned earlier in these instructions.</description>",
