Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the Translation Vector to [0.0034, 0.0654, 0.0034]. **Step 2: Draw Sketch Face 1** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane. Draw the first face with a single loop. In the loop, create a circle centered at (0.1832, 0.1832) with a radius of 0.1832 units. **Step 3: Draw Sketch Face 2** Draw the second face perpendicular to the first face using the same coordinate system. This face should also be on the X-Y plane. Create a loop with four curves - two lines and two arcs: 1. Line connecting points (0.2239, 0.0046) and (0.6842, 0.1093) 2. Arc centered at (0.6842, 0.1832) with a radius of 0.0758 units, connecting points (0.6842, 0.1093) and (0.6842, 0.2571) 3. Line connecting points (0.6842, 0.2571) and (0.2239, 0.3618) 4.

With radius 0.0758 units 2. With radius 0.0315 units **Step 5: Scale and Extrude Sketch** Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.7431 along the Z-axis. Extrude the scaled sketch in the positive direction of the normal vector by 0.0654 units. The result is a simple, flat, rectangular metal bracket with a hole in the center, as described in the JSON. The bracket's final dimensions are: - Length: 0.7431 units - Width: 0.0654 units - Height: 0.7431 units (Note: This does not include the additional height from the extrusion. Adjust dimensions accordingly).</description>",
