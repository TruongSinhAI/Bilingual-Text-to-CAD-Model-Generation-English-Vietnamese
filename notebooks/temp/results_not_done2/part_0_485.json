However, the JSON provides absolute coordinates for these lines (e.g., \"  , \"[0.0, 0.175]\"  , \"), not relative to a local face origin.

Furthermore, the complete omission of extrusion parameters for Part 2 and the lack of any description for Part 3 make the description insufficient and inconsistent with the full JSON. Therefore, the description does not match the JSON.\\n</think>"
