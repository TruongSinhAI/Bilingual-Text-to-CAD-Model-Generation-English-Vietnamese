Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.0525 towards the normal and 0 towards the opposite direction, joining the new part to the preceding model.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description clearly defines three parts: \"  \n  ,\"Part 1\"  \n  , \"  ,\"  \n  ,\"Part 2\"  \n  ,\" and \"  \n  ,\"Part 3\"  \n  ,\".
