Extrude the sketch by 0.064 units in the positive Z direction to create a solid object. This will result in a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. Note: The final shape is a combination of these parts. To create the final shape, start with Part 1 and follow the parts in order, using JoinFeatureOperation when appropriate. The final shape should be a cylindrical object with a tapered end, resembling a pipe or a tube. It has a smooth surface and appears to be a solid object. The object is centered and occupies a significant portion of the image.</description>",

However, the provided JSON *only* contains `loop_1` and its associated elements (`arc_1`, `line_1`, `line_2`). The entire `loop_2` is **missing** from the JSON. Similar to `line_1`, the description for `line_3` states \\\"Draw line-3 from the endpoint of arc-2 to (0.4366, 0.3542)\\\", which also suggests a zero-length line. Given the absence of `loop_2` in the JSON, this is a significant mismatch.\\n\\n- Correction: The JSON is missing `loop_2` entirely, which is explicitly described.
