The front and back faces are parallel to each other, while the side faces are perpendicular to both the top and bottom faces. The object is centered on a white background. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0.0168, 0.0039, 0) with no rotation. 1. **Face 1** Draw a rectangle with the following vertices: (0, 0), (0.7164, 0), (0.7164, 0.6647), (0, 0.6647). This will create the first face of the prism. **Part 2** Create a second three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0, 0, 0.0039) with no rotation. 1. **Face 1** Draw a rectangle with the following vertices: (0.0129, 0), (0.7371, 0), (0.7371, 0.6724), (0.0129, 0.6724).
