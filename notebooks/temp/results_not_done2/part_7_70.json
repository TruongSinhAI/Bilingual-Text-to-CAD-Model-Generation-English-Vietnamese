The prism has a slightly tapered shape, with the narrowest point at the top. The sides of the prism are parallel and meet at right angles.

Use the CutFeatureOperation boolean operation to remove materials from the preceding CAD models. This will create a rectangular prism with rounded corners. Final Shape The final shape of the CAD assembly is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a smaller rectangular protrusion on top.

If we strictly follow the JSON, the description should have specified \"                 , \"Extrude... along the opposite direction of the normal by 0.375 units\"                 , \".\\n\\n- Conclusion: The description for Part 2's extrusion is inconsistent with the provided JSON.
