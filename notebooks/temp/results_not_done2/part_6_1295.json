The object has a rectangular cross-section and is slightly tapered towards the bottom. To create this shape, we will first create an intermediate CAD part, and then extrude it to form the final shape.

The prism has a hollow center and is slightly angled towards the front face. The final shape consists of two intermediate parts. Part 1: Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]. Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system and draw a five-sided polygon as follows: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.125] * Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.125], End Point [0.125, 0.25] * Line 4: Start Point [0.125, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.25] * Line 5: Start Point [0.0, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Close the loop and scale the sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. Extrude the sketch by 0.375 units towards the normal direction. Part 2: Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees and a translation vector of [0.125, 0.0, 0.25]. Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system and draw a rectangle as follows: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.625, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.625, 0.0], End Point [0.625, 0.125] * Line 3: Start Point [0.625, 0.125], End Point [0.0, 0.125] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.125], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Create a second sketch on face 2 of the coordinate system and draw a rectangle that is identical to the first rectangle. Close the loops for both sketches. Extrude the sketches in the opposite normal direction by 0.125 units to remove material from the first part. Scale the sketches using a scaling factor of 0.625.</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description clearly outlines two parts: \"\n    ,\"Part 1\", \" and \"\n    ,\"Part 2\", \".\\n\\npart_1: (Main Prism Body)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From \"\n    ,\"euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees\", \")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.0] (From \"\n    ,\"translation vector of [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]\", \")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1: Consists of 5 lines, with specified Start Point and End Point for each.\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0]\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.125]\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.125], End Point [0.125, 0.25]\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.125, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.25]\\n----line_5: Start Point [0.0, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.0]\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.375 (From \"\n    ,\"Extrude the sketch by 0.375 units towards the normal direction\", \")\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred, as no opposite extrusion is mentioned for a \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", \")\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (From \"\n    ,\"scale the sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75\", \")\\n--operation: \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", \" (Inferred, as this is the initial creation of the first part)\\n\\npart_2: (Material Cut)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (From \"\n    ,\"euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees\", \")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.125, 0.0, 0.25] (From \"\n    ,\"translation vector of [0.125, 0.0, 0.25]\", \")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1: Consists of 4 lines, forming a rectangle.\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.625, 0.0]\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.625, 0.0], End Point [0.625, 0.125]\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.625, 0.125], End Point [0.0, 0.125]\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.125], End Point [0.0, 0.0]\\n--face_2:\\n---loop_1: Described as \"\n    ,\"identical to the first rectangle\", \".

All inferred data accurately reflects the JSON structure and values, matching the modified description for both parts.\\n</think>"
