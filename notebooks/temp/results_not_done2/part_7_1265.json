Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.3953, 0.0] Next, create a sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch consists of one face with two loops: the first loop is a circle, and the second loop is a series of connected lines. Here are the detailed instructions for each loop: **Loop 1 - Circle:** - Center: [0.375, 0.375] - Radius: 0.375 **Loop 2 - Connected Lines:** - Line 1: Start Point [0.1571, 0.2787], End Point [0.1571, 0.4713] - Line 2: Start Point [0.1571, 0.4713], End Point [0.2787, 0.4713] - Line 3: Start Point [0.2787, 0.4713], End Point [0.2787, 0.5929] - Line 4: Start Point [0.2787, 0.5929], End Point [0.375, 0.5929] - Line 5: Start Point [0.375, 0.5929], End Point [0.4713, 0.5929] - Line 6: Start Point [0.4713, 0.5929], End Point [0.4713, 0.4713] - Line 7: Start Point [0.4713, 0.4713], End Point [0.5929, 0.4713] - Line 8: Start Point [0.5929, 0.4713], End Point [0.5929, 0.2787] - Line 9: Start Point [0.5929, 0.2787], End Point [0.4713, 0.2787] - Line 10: Start Point [0.4713, 0.2787], End Point [0.4713, 0.1571] - Line 11: Start Point [0.4713, 0.1571], End Point [0.2787, 0.1571] - Line 12: Start Point [0.2787, 0.1571], End Point [0.2787, 0.2787] - Line 13: Start Point [0.2787, 0.2787], End Point [0.1571, 0.2787] All loops are closed. This sketch is now complete, and the software should confirm that it is fully constrained. The final step for this part is to extrude the sketch in the positive Z direction, with the following properties: - Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.3953 - Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0 - Sketch Scale: 0.75 -
