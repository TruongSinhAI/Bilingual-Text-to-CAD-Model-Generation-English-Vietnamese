Loop 3 Loop 3 is a circle centered at [0.1267, 0.6081] with a radius of 0.0111. Extrusion Extrude the sketch by 0.1216 units towards the positive Z direction (towards the normal) and by 0 units in the opposite direction of the normal. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6486. This will create a 3D solid body from the 2D sketch. The final shape of Part 1 is a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom.
