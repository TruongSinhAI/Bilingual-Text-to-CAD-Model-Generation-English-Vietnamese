It is symmetrical along its central axis. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. 1. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. This creates a coordinate system where the X and Y axes remain unchanged, and the Z axis is rotated -90 degrees around the X axis. The origin of this coordinate system is located at 0, 0.75, 0 in the global coordinate system. 2. Create a new face in the XY plane. 3. Create one loop having a single circle. 3.1. Center the circle at [0.25, 0.25]. 3.2. Set the radius to 0.25. 4. Scale the 2D sketch so that the overall size is reduced by 50% (sketch_scale = 0.5). 5. Extrude the sketch towards the normal by 0.75 units. This step will create a solid cylindrical object. The height of this object will be 0.5 units (0.75 units of extrusion from the initial Z coordinate 0.25, as specified in the Translation Vector). The width is 0.75 units, and its length is 0.5 units (corresponding to the diameter of the circle). Part 2: Tapered Rectangular Prism Create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a tapered top and a flat bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. 1. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.1213, 0.0, 0.1013]. Similar to part 1, this defines a local coordinate system rotated around the X axis. The origin of this coordinate system is located at 0.1213, 0, 0.1013 in the global coordinate system. 2. Create a new face in the XY plane. 3. Create a single loop consisting of six lines forming a closed shape. 3.1. Connect the points (0.0, 0.0743) to (0.1287, 0.0), (0.1287, 0.0) to (0.2575, 0.0743), (0.2575, 0.0743) to (0.2575, 0.223), (0.2575, 0.223) to (0.1287, 0.2973), and (0.1287, 0.2973) to (0.0, 0.223). 4. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.2973. 5. Extrude the loop inward (opposite to the normal) by a depth of 0.75 units. This extrusion will remove this part of the cylindrical base object, resulting in the desired appearance of a tapered rectangular prism on top. The dimensions of this prism are approximately 0.2973 x 0.75 x 0.2973 units. Note that these instructions are provided without any specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation' or 'CutFeatureOperation'.
