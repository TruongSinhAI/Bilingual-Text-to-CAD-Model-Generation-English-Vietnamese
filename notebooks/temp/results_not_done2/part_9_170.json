Extrude the sketch by 0.1875 units towards the normal and 0.1875 units in the opposite direction of the normal. **Part 2: 3D model of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The model has a hollow center and is composed of two identical halves.** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 degrees and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.6536. For the sketch, create two new faces and add loops with the following line segments: Face 1: - Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.0) - Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.1071) - Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.1071), End Point (0.0, 0.1071) - Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.1071), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Face 2: - Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.6429), End Point (0.75, 0.6429) - Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0.6429), End Point (0.75, 0.75) - Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.75), End Point (0.0, 0.75) - Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.75), End Point (0.0, 0.6429) Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Extrude the sketch by 0.5464 units in the opposite direction of the normal. The resulting shapes will combine to form a three-dimensional geometric shape with a flat base and a tapering top, resembling a pyramid, where the length is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 1.2999 units.</description>",
