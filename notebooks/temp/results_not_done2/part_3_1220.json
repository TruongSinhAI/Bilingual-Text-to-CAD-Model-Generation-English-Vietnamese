Step 6: Extrude Sketch Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model with the specified depth towards the normal (0.0) and opposite the normal (0.15), following the sketch scale (0.75). Define the boolean operation as joining or adding material to the existing body. Step 7: Describe the Shape The final shape is a cylindrical object with a series of holes around its circumference.
