Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 - Translation Vector: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 Now, let's create the 2D sketch for this part on the XY plane of the coordinate system. **Sketch Face 1:** The sketch consists of a single face (Face 1). Face 1 contains a single loop (Loop 1), which includes eight connected line segments. Here's the detailed breakdown of the loop: - Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.0717, 0.0) - Line 2: Start Point (0.0717, 0.0), End Point (0.0717, 0.1304) - Line 3: Start Point (0.0717, 0.1304), End Point (0.0, 0.1304) - Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.1304), End Point (0.0, 0.1174) - Line 5: Start Point (0.0, 0.1174), End Point (0.0326, 0.1174) - Line 6: Start Point (0.0326, 0.1174), End Point (0.0326, 0.0913) - Line 7: Start Point (0.0326, 0.0913), End Point (0.0, 0.0913) - Line 8: Start Point (0.0, 0.0913), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Remember to ensure that Loop 1 is closed. Now, let's transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system we created earlier. The final step is to extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use the following extrusion properties: - Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.75 - Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 - Sketch Scale: 0.1304 - Operation: Create a new solid body This part is a 0.75 units tall curved rectangular prism with the following dimensions: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.1304 units - Height: 0.1304 units With this part completed, you can proceed with creating subsequent parts according to the provided JSON.</description>",

Extrusion Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with the following properties: - Extrusion depth towards the normal: 0.1213 - Extrusion depth opposite the normal: 0 - Sketch scale: 0.75 - Operation: Create a new solid body The final shape of part 1 is a rectangular prism with a height of 0.1213, a width of 0.75, and a length of 0.75. The top edge has a curved profile. Continue with the next part by creating the coordinate system based on the previous part's extrusion or any external reference if provided. In this example, you should create the second part's coordinate system based on part 1's extrusion. After creating the coordinate system for part 2, follow the same format described above to detail the construction of the second part. Remember to avoid using specific boolean operation terms and describe each part's shape instead. In this example, since I only provided one part, the final shape of the assembly would be the same as the first part. For the second part and any consecutive parts, make sure to provide the coordinate system, sketch, extrusion, and description information as before.
