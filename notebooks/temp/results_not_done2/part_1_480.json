    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Instructions Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Next, create the 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. This sketch contains a single face (face_1) with a single loop (loop_1) composed of the following curves: - line_1: A straight line with a start point at [0.0, 0.0] and an end point at [0.3638, 0.0]. - line_2: A straight line with a start point at [0.3638, 0.0] and an end point at [0.3638, 0.2925]. - line_3: A straight line with a start point at [0.3638, 0.2925] and an end point at [0.0, 0.2925]. - line_4: A straight line with a start point at [0.0, 0.2925] and an end point at [0.0, 0.0]. implying that loop_1 is a rectangle, with 4 lines forming its boundary. Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.3638 using the sketch_scale scaling parameter. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the following euler angles and translation vector: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Extrude the 2D sketch in the direction of the normal by a depth of 0.75 units, resulting in the creation of the three-dimensional rectangular prism. The height of this part is 0.75 units. Please note that the length and width of this part are both 0.3638 units as determined by the scaling factor and the shape of the rectangle in the sketch. With these instructions, the junior CAD designer should be able to generate the parametric CAD model for part_1 as described in the given CAD Assembly JSON.</description>",
