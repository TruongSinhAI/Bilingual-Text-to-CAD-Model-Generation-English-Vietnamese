    "reasoning": "<description>\\nPart 1: Rectangular Prism The first part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal and the height is half the length of the sides. Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles as follows: * X-axis (0.0°): 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 Set the translation vector as follows: * X-axis (0.0395): 0.0, 0.0395, 0.0 Sketching Draw the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system.
