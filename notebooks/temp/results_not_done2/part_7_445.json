Part 2 sketch geometry: The description states to \\\"Repeat the above steps for the other two faces (face 2 and face 3) of the coordinate system, mirroring the arc accordingly.\\\" However, the JSON provides *explicit and distinct* coordinates for lines and arcs in `face_2` and `face_3` which are not simply mirrored versions of `face_1`'s geometry (e.g., `arc_1` mid-points differ). The description is vague and does not fully specify the actual geometry for `face_2` and `face_3` as represented in the JSON. This constitutes a mismatch in the detailed geometric instructions.\\n-Check Part 3: All properties (coordinate system, sketch circle, extrusion parameters, scale, operation) match the JSON.\\n\\n-Correction: The description for Part 2 needs to explicitly state the geometry (lines and arcs with their specific coordinates) for `face_2` and `face_3` as they are defined in the JSON, rather than relying on a \\\"repeat\\\" or \\\"mirroring\\\" instruction which is not fully accurate given the JSON's detailed geometry.\\n</think>"
