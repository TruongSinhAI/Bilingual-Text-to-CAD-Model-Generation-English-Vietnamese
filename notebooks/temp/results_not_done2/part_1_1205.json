Step 2: Drawing the Sketch Next, we need to draw a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Step 3: Creating Faces and Loops We are going to create five faces in this sketch.

Step 4: Scaling the Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.1071. Step 5: Transforming the Sketch Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Step 6: Extruding the Sketch Extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.1875 units in the positive Z direction and the same depth in the negative Z direction. This will create a 3D solid model with a height of 0.1071 units, a width of 0.375 units, and a length of 0.1071 units. The result is a rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one of its faces, positioned at a 45-degree angle from the bottom.</description>",
