For the sketch, create a single face (face\\\\_1) and add a loop (loop\\\\_1) to it. The loop should consist of the following four line segments: 1. line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] 2. line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.625] 3. line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.75, 0.625], End Point = [0.0, 0.625] 4. line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.625], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the `sketch_scale` parameter, resulting in a smaller rectangular shape. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles (-90.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector [0.0, 0.5, 0.0]. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.5 units towards the normal and 0.0 units in the opposite direction, using the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` parameters, respectively. The resulting intermediate CAD part will have the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.5 * Height: 0.75 Use the `NewBodyFeatureOperation` for the operation, which will create a new solid body for this part.
