It is a simple rectangular shape with equal length and width, and a height that is approximately twice the width. The specific dimensions of this part are: - Height: 0.75 units - Width: 0.0078 units - Length: 0.75 units To construct this part, follow these steps: 1. **Create a new coordinate system**. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees, and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0078, 0.0] units. 2. **Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system**. The sketch should consist of a single face, face_1, with a loop_1 that is made up of the following curves: - line_1: A horizontal line starting at (0.0, 0.0) and ending at (0.75, 0.0) units. - line_2: A vertical line starting at (0.75, 0.0) and ending at (0.75, 0.0375) units. - line_3: A horizontal line starting at (0.75, 0.0375) and ending at (0.75, 0.075) units. - line_4: A vertical line starting at (0.75, 0.075) and ending at (0.0, 0.075) units. - line_5: A horizontal line starting at (0.0, 0.075) and ending at (0.0, 0.0) units. Note that the loop is closed, and contains 5 curves. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** by a factor of 0.75. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch**. The orientation of the sketch should be based on the coordinate system defined in step 1. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch to create a 3D model**. The extrude depth should be set to 0.0078 units towards the normal, and 0.0 units opposite the normal. The sketch scale should be set to 0.75. The operation is to create a new solid body.</description>",

We will be drawing on face 1 of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single loop, which in turn consists of 11 line segments. 1. The first line segment starts at (0, 0.3103) and ends at (0.0884, 0.116). 2. The second line segment starts at (0.0884, 0.116) and ends at (0.2678, 0.0003). 3.

The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.049, and the depth opposite the normal is 0.0. We will also scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 before extruding. The boolean operation for this part is to create a new solid body. The dimensions of the intermediate part are: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.75 units * Height: 0.049 units The final shape of the CAD model, as given in the JSON, is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides of the prism are parallel and meet at right angles. The prism is centered on a white background. The dimensions of the final shape match those of the intermediate part.</description>",
