    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Cylindrical Object** The first part is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end and a smooth surface. It appears to be made of a reflective material and is symmetrical along its length with a uniform diameter throughout. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. **Sketch** Create a new sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Within this sketch, create a single face (face\\\\_1). On this face, create a loop (loop\\\\_1) consisting of one circle (circle\\\\_1). The circle has a center at (0.0255, 0.0255) and a radius of 0.0255. **Extrusion** Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.75 units and do not extrude in the opposite direction. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.051 before extruding. The resulting 3D model is the first part. The part has a length of 0.051 units, a width of 0.051 units, and a height of 0.75 units. **Part 2: Tapered Cylindrical Object** The second part is a tapered cylindrical object that gradually narrows towards one end. It has a smooth surface and appears to be made of a reflective material. The object is symmetrical along its length and has a uniform diameter throughout, except for the tapered end. It is positioned horizontally against a plain, light background. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. **Sketch** Create a new sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Within this sketch, create two overlapping circles (circle\\\\_1 and circle\\\\_2) with the same center point. The first circle (circle\\\\_1) has a radius of 0.0255 units, and the second circle (circle\\\\_2) has a slightly smaller radius. **Extrusion** Extrude the sketch along the normal by a distance that gradually decreases towards the end of the object. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.051 before extruding. The resulting 3D model is the second part. The part has a length of 0.1 units, a width of 0.051 units, and a height of 0.1 units. **Part 3: Cylindrical Object with Flat End** The third part is a cylindrical object with a flat end. It has a smooth surface and appears to be made of a reflective material. The object is symmetrical along its length and has a uniform diameter throughout, except for the flat end. It is positioned horizontally against a plain, light background. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. **Sketch** Create a new sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Within this sketch, create two overlapping circles (circle\\\\_1 and circle\\\\_2) with the same center point. The first circle (circle\\\\_1) has a radius of 0.0255 units, and the second circle (circle\\\\_2) has a slightly larger radius. **Extrusion** Extrude the sketch along the normal by a fixed distance, except for the area covered by the larger circle. In this area, extrude by a smaller distance to create a flat end. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.051 before extruding. The resulting 3D model is the third part. The part has a length of 0.075 units, a width of 0.051 units, and a height of 0.075 units. The final shape is the combination of the three parts. Position the parts relative to each other to create the desired shape. Use the boolean operation 'JoinFeatureOperation' to combine the parts into a single solid body.
