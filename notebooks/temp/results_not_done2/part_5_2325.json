Use the following parameters for the extrusion: * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.25 * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 * Sketch Scale: 0.75 * Operation: New Solid Body The resulting prism will have the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.25 * Height: 0.75 The final shape will have a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side at a 45 degree angle.
