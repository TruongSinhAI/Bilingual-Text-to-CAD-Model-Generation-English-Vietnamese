However, calling it a \"\n      ,\"rectangle\"\n      ,\" is misleading as the fourth point [0.413, 0.0341] is the start of an arc, not a closing line, and the vertices do not form a closed rectangle.

Specifically, the point [0.1033, 0.0341] mentioned in the description is not present in the JSON's loop_1 sequence as a vertex for line_4, line_5, line_6, or arc_2.
