The part is positioned at an angle, with the cylindrical hole facing towards the top right corner. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system for the part. The euler angles for the coordinate system should be [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees, and the translation vector should be [0.0, 0.45, 0.0]. Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch for the rectangular prism Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system.

Step 5: Extrude the 3D model from the 2D sketch Extrude the 3D model from the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.45 units towards the normal direction. Step 6: Create a cylindrical hole in the 3D model Create a cylindrical hole with a larger diameter at the bottom and a smaller diameter at the top. The cylinder should be positioned at an angle, with the larger end facing towards the top right corner of the part. Step 7: Finalize the part Finalize the part by setting the appropriate operation for combining this part with preceding CAD models. In this case, create a new solid body.
