The height of the base part is approximately twice its diameter, and it has a slightly tapered shape, narrowing slightly towards the center. The part is centered in the CAD model. The base part of the cylindrical object is constructed using a 2D sketch of a circle, which is then scaled and transformed into a 3D sketch. The 3D sketch is then extruded to create the final part. The height of the base part is 0.0167 times the width and length of the part.
