Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. 3. Draw a circle with the following properties: - Center: [0.0625, 0.0625] - Radius: 0.0625 4. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.125. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the following parameters: - Euler Angles: -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 - Translation Vector: 0.375, 0.0, 0.0 6. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following properties: - Extrude depth towards normal: 0.1875 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.1875 The length, width, and height of this part are 0.375, 0.125, and 0.125 units, respectively. **Observation:** The first part is a simple cylindrical object with a circular base and a uniform height. The circular base is drawn with a center point located at (0.0625, 0.0625) and a radius of 0.0625 units. The circular base is then scaled by a factor of 0.125, transformed into 3D, and extruded along the Z-axis with a depth of 0.1875 units for both the normal and opposite directions. The final shape of the first part has a uniform height of 0.125 units and a base diameter of 0.125 units.</description>",
