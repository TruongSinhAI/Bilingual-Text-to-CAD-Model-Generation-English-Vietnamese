The loop is closed and consists of 6 arcs and 6 lines. Use the sketch as is, without any scaling, to create a 3D model by extruding the sketch depth of 0.75 towards the normal and 0.0 in the opposite direction. This results in a final CAD part size of 0.6067 (length) x 0.6067 (width) x 0.75 (height). The boolean operation for this part is \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\".</description>",
