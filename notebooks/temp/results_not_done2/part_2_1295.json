    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1 Shape: A rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to: [0.0, 0.0441, 0.0]. Next, create the 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. * The sketch contains 1 face (face_1). * face_1 contains 1 loop (loop_1). * loop_1 contains 10 lines (line_1 to line_10) with the following start and end points: 1. line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] 2. line_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.3309] 3. line_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.3309], End Point [0.0221, 0.3309] 4. line_4: Start Point [0.0221, 0.3309], End Point [0.0221, 0.2482] 5. line_5: Start Point [0.0221, 0.2482], End Point [0.0, 0.2482] 6. line_6: Start Point [0.0, 0.2482], End Point [0.0, 0.1654] 7. line_7: Start Point [0.0, 0.1654], End Point [0.0221, 0.1654] 8. line_8: Start Point [0.0221, 0.1654], End Point [0.0221, 0.0827] 9. line_9: Start Point [0.0221, 0.0827], End Point [0.0, 0.0827] 10. line_10: Start Point [0.0, 0.0827], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Now, scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter sketch_scale, which is 0.75.
