For the extrusion, set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.0469 and the extrude depth opposite normal to 0.0469. Set the sketch scale to 0.375. This will create a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered middle section. **Construct a Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom (Part 2)** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.1875, 0.0, 0.0938.
