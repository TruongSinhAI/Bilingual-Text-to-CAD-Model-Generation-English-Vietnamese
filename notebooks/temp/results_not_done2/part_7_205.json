    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Cylindrical Object with Central Hole Construct a cylindrical object with a central hole, resembling a tube or pipe. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. For the first face of the sketch (face_1): 1. Create an arc (arc_1) starting at [0.0, 0.125], with a midpoint at [0.1264, 0.0327], ending at [0.2795, 0.0]. 2. Draw a line (line_1) from [0.2795, 0.0] to [0.2795, 0.25]. 3. Create an arc (arc_2) starting at [0.2795, 0.25], with a midpoint at [0.1911, 0.2866], ending at [0.1545, 0.375]. 4. Draw a line (line_2) from [0.1545, 0.375] to [0.0, 0.375]. 5. Lastly, draw a line (line_3) from [0.0, 0.375] back to the starting point at [0.0, 0.125]. Create a closed loop with this sequence: arc_1, line_1, arc_2, line_2, and line_3. This loop represents the outline of an off-centered, flattened circle on the X-Y plane. For the second face of the sketch (face_2): 1. Draw a line (line_1) from [0.0, 0.375] to [0.1545, 0.375]. 2. Draw a line (line_2) from [0.0, 0.625] to [0.0, 0.375]. 3. Create an arc (arc_1) starting at [0.2795, 0.0], with a midpoint at [0.6218, 0.5281], ending at [0.0, 0.625]. 4. Connect lines from [0.2795, 0.0] to [0.2795, 0.25], then draw an arc (arc_2) which starts at [0.2795, 0.25], has a midpoint at [0.3679, 0.4634], and ends at [0.1545, 0.375] to close the loop. Create a second closed loop with this sequence: line_1, line_2, arc_1, line_3, and arc_2. This loop forms the outer boundary of the off-centered, flattened circle while combining with the existing loop from face_1 to create the complete outline for the cylinder with a central hole. After creating the sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.625, then transform and extrude it using the specified Euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system. Use the scaling parameter from the \"extrusion\" section (sketch_scale) to adjust the size of the sketch before transforming and extruding it. The extrusion operation creates a 3D cylindrical object with a central hole (resulting from the negative space between the two loops). Set the \"operation\" parameter within the \"extrusion\" object to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\". The final shape will have dimensions as follows: - Height: 0.5 (from \"description\" section) - Width: 0.625 (from the sketch_scale - felt reasonable here) - Length: 0.625 (from the sketch_scale - felt reasonable given this instruction)</description>",
