    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** **Step 1: Define the Coordinate System** Create a new coordinate system with the Euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0938]. This coordinate system will be used as the reference for the 2D sketch that we will create in the next step. **Step 2: Create the 2D Sketch** Using the coordinate system defined in the previous step, create a new 2D sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. The sketch should consist of four lines that form a rectangle. The lines should have the following start and end points: Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.5625, 0.0] Line 2: Start Point [0.5625, 0.0], End Point [0.5625, 0.75] Line 3: Start Point [0.5625, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This will create a rectangle with a length of 0.75 units and a width of 0.5625 units. **Step 3: Scale the 2D Sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. This will reduce the size of the rectangle to a length of 0.5625 units and a width of 0.4219 units. **Step 4: Transform the Scaled 2D Sketch into 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the same coordinate system. The euler angles and translation vector will remain unchanged. **Step 5: Extrude the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by a depth of 0.0938 units to generate the 3D model. The resulting shape will be a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. **Part 2: Rectangular Prism with a Sloped Side** **Step 1: Define the Coordinate System** Create a new coordinate system with the Euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector set to [0.0188, 0.0188, 0.0938]. This coordinate system will be used as the reference for the 2D sketch that we will create in the next step. **Step 2: Create the 2D Sketch** Using the coordinate system defined in the previous step, create a new 2D sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. The sketch should consist of two rectangles. The first rectangle should be identical to the one created in Part 1. The second rectangle should be nested inside the first rectangle and should have a length of 0.4125 units and a width of 0.4125 units. **Step 3: Extrude the Nested Rectangle** Extrude the nested rectangle along the normal direction by a depth of 0.0375 units. **Step 4: Create a Line on the Extruded Surface** Create a line on the extruded surface that connects the top-left corner of the nested rectangle to the bottom-right corner of the nested rectangle. **Step 5: Remove the Top Face of the Nested Rectangle** Remove the top face of the nested rectangle. This will create a sloped side on the rectangular prism. The resulting shape will be a 3D CAD model of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The prism is centered on a white background. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 0.7125 units by 0.7125 units by 0.0375 units.</description>",
