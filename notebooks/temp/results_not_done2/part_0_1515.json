The top and bottom are parallel to each other, and the side curves smoothly between them. The object appears to be a simple, three-dimensional shape with no additional features or details. * Length: 0.7332 * Width: 0.7332 * Height: 0.4934 **Instructions** 1. Construct a new coordinate system according to the given Euler angles and translation vector. 2. Draw the 2D sketch on the sketch plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch will consist of a single face (Face 1). 3. Within Face 1, create Loop 1. This loop will consist of 4 curves: Arc 1, Line 1, Arc 2, and Line 2. 4. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.7332. 5. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified Euler angles and translation vector. 6. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.4934 units, creating a solid 3D model. **Note**: Pay attention to the curvature and parallelism of the top and bottom surfaces. Ensure that the side curves smoothly join them. The final shape should have no additional features or details beyond those specified.</description>",
