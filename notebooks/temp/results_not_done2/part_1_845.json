Draw a smaller circle inside the first one with center at (0.1446, 0.1446) and radius 0.0795 (this creates loop 2). 3. Draw the second face of the sketch: a.

Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 6. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.1268 units and in the opposite direction by 0 units. 7. The resulting shape is a cylindrical object with two holes on opposite sides, one larger than the other. The length, width, and height of this part are approximately 0.75, 0.75, and 0.1268 units, respectively. **Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Flat Top and Bottom** 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. 2. Draw the first face of the sketch: a.

Draw a smaller circle inside the first one with center at (0.1446, 0.1446) and radius 0.0795 (this creates loop 2). 3. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.2893. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 5. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.2462 units and in the opposite direction by 0 units. 6. The resulting shape is a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. The cylinder has a smooth surface and is slightly tapered towards the bottom. The top and bottom edges are sharp. The object is centered and occupies most of the image.
