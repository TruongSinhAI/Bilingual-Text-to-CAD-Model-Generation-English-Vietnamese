The `operation` as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" is also a reasonable inference for the initial extrusion of a new part.\\n-Overall Shape Description vs. Geometry: The initial description states \\\"rectangular prism with a pointed top\\\". While the combined sketch outline (composed of face_1 and face_2's main loops) is not a simple rectangle, it could lead to a 'pointed' aspect in the final 3D shape upon extrusion due to the sloped lines in face_2. The term \\\"rectangular prism\\\" may be a loose classification given the complex profile, but the specific geometric instructions are faithfully translated to the JSON.\\n-Corrections: No corrections needed for the values inferred from the specific CAD instructions. The high-level description of the shape might be a slight generalization, but the detailed geometry matches.\\n</think>"
