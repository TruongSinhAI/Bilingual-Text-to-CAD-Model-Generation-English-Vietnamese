However, the JSON's `face_1` also contains a `loop_2` with `circle_1` (Center [0.2212, 0.2212], Radius 0.0608), which is not described. This is a discrepancy. --face_2: The description for `face_2`'s `loop_1` with its lines and arcs matches the JSON exactly. The connectivity of the lines and arcs forms a closed loop. --face_3: The description for `face_3` with its two circles (loop_1 and loop_2) perfectly matches the JSON. -Check extrusion parameters: The extrusion depths (towards normal 0.1106, opposite normal 0.0), sketch scale (0.75), and operation (\"\n            ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n            ,\") are all consistent with the JSON and description. -Overall validation: Due to the missing description for `face_1`'s `loop_2` in the sketch, the description does not fully match the JSON. -Correction: The description for `face_1`'s sketch needs to be updated to include `loop_2` (the second circle with radius 0.0608). </think>"
