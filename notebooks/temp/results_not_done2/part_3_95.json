The resulting shape is a new solid body.\\\\n</description>\\\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\\\n<think>\\\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\\\n\\\\n`parts`: Contains `part_1`.\\\\n`part_1`:\\\\n- `coordinate_system`:\\\\n  - `Euler Angles`: `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` (From \\\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\\")\\\\n  - `Translation Vector`: `[0.0, 0.0462, 0.0]` (From \\\"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0462, 0.0]\\\")\\\\n- `sketch`:\\\\n  - `face_1`: (From \\\"create a new sketch on face 1\\\")\\\\n    - `loop_1`: (From \\\"Loop 1:\\\")\\\\n      - `arc_1`: Start `[0.0, 0.0639]`, Mid `[0.0639, 0.0]`, End `[0.1277, 0.0639]`\\\\n      - `line_1`: Start `[0.1277, 0.0639]`, End `[0.5573, 0.1126]`\\\\n      - `arc_2`: Start `[0.5573, 0.1126]`, Mid `[0.6894, 0.1777]`, End `[0.75, 0.312]`\\\\n      - `line_2`: Start `[0.75, 0.312]`, End `[0.75, 0.3555]`\\\\n      - `arc_3`: Start `[0.75, 0.3555]`, Mid `[0.6926, 0.4947]`, End `[0.5573, 0.5608]`\\\\n      - `line_3`: Start `[0.5573, 0.5608]`, End `[0.1277, 0.6002]`\\\\n      - `arc_4`: Start `[0.1277, 0.6002]`, Mid `[0.0639, 0.5364]`, End `[0.0, 0.6002]`\\\\n      - `line_4`: Start `[0.0, 0.6002]`, End `[0.0, 0.0639]`\\\\n- `extrusion`: (From \\\"Extrude the sketch in the normal direction...\\\")\\\\n  - `extrude_depth_towards_normal`: `0.0462` (From \\\"depth of 0.0462\\\")\\\\n  - `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`: `0.0` (From \\\"no extrusion in the opposite direction\\\")\\\\n  - `sketch_scale`: `0.75` (From \\\"Apply a sketch scale of 0.75\\\")\\\\n  - `operation`: `\\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\"` (From \\\"The resulting shape is a new solid body\\\")\\\\n\\\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\\\n\\\\n- Coordinate system parameters are correctly matched.\\\\n- `loop_1` curves connectivity:\\\\n  - `arc_1` End `[0.1277, 0.0639]` matches `line_1` Start `[0.1277, 0.0639]`\\\\n  - `line_1` End `[0.5573, 0.1126]` matches `arc_2` Start `[0.5573, 0.1126]`\\\\n  - `arc_2` End `[0.75, 0.312]` matches `line_2` Start `[0.75, 0.312]`\\\\n  - `line_2` End `[0.75, 0.3555]` matches `arc_3` Start `[0.75, 0.3555]`\\\\n  - `arc_3` End `[0.5573, 0.5608]` matches `line_3` Start `[0.5573, 0.5608]`\\\\n  - `line_3` End `[0.1277, 0.6002]` matches `arc_4` Start `[0.1277, 0.6002]`\\\\n  - `arc_4` End `[0.0, 0.6002]` matches `line_4` Start `[0.0, 0.6002]`\\\\n  - `line_4` End `[0.0, 0.0639]` matches `arc_1` Start `[0.0, 0.0639]`\\\\n  - Result: `loop_1` forms a closed and correctly defined contour.
