Instead, they are translated in the Y-direction (face_4 starts at Y=0.2546, face_5 at Y=0.5023, while face_1,2,3 are at Y=0).

However, the sketch is made up of multiple rectangular loops, not a single shape with a \"\n    ,\"curved side\",\n    \". This is also a discrepancy.\\n\\n-Correction: Due to the mismatch in Euler angles and the inconsistent description of faces 4 and 5 (claiming rotation when it's a translation in JSON), and the general shape description not matching the granular sketch, the description does not fully match the JSON.\\n</think>"
