    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with an Angled Front Face The first part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The prism has a flat base and a flat top, with an angled front face that is approximately 0.0811 units deep. The overall dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 1 unit in height. Sketching the Base: 1. Create a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with no rotation. 2. Draw the base of the prism on the X-Y plane. Begin by drawing a line from (0, 0.3243) to (0.2027, 0.3243). 3. Draw a line from (0.2027, 0.3243) to (0.2027, 0). 4. Draw a line from (0.2027, 0) to (0.5473, 0). 5. Draw a line from (0.5473, 0) to (0.5473, 0.3243). 6.

Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0811 units. 3. Use the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" to create a new solid body from the extruded sketch. This concludes the creation of the first part, a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The prism has a flat base and a flat top, with an angled front face that is approximately 0.0811 units deep.
