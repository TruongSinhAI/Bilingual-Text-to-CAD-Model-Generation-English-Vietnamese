    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Metal Bracket with a Center Hole** Construct a rectangular metal bracket with a center hole. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of [0, 0, 0]. First, create the top face of the bracket by sketching a rectangle. The first line has a start point of [0, 0.0584] and end point of [0.2524, 0.0584]. The second line continues the rectangle, starting at [0.2524, 0.0584] and ending at [0.2524, 0.2452]. The third line starts at the same point, [0.2524, 0.2452], and ends at [0, 0.2452]. The final line starts at [0, 0.2452] and ends at [0, 0.0584]. Next, create a circle on the same face for the center hole. The circle's center should be at [0.087, 0.1518], and its radius should be 0.0286. Then, create the bottom face of the bracket by sketching a circle. The circle should be centered at [0.372, 0.1518] with a radius of 0.1518. Now, create a third face by sketching another rectangle, but this time starting from the bottom right corner of the first sketch. This rectangle should have lines starting at [0.4917, 0.0584] and ending at [0.75, 0.0584], [0.75, 0.0584] and [0.75, 0.2452], [0.75, 0.2452] and [0.4917, 0.2452], and finally [0.4917, 0.2452] and [0.4917, 0.0584]. Add a circular cutout by sketching a circle with a center at [0.663, 0.1518] and a radius of 0.0286 on this face. Once all the sketches are complete, use a NewBodyFeatureOperation with a sketch scale of 0.75, and an extrude depth towards normal of 0.0701. The final height, width and length of this part should be approximately 0.5 units (0.0701 * 2 + 0.0286 * 2), 1 unit and 0.75 units respectively. **Part 2: Cylindrical Hole** Construct a cylindrical hole for the bracket. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles [0, 0, 0], and a translation vector of [0.2552, 0.035, 0.0701]. Create a circle on the X-Y plane using a circular sketch for this coordinate system. The circle's center should be at [0.1168, 0.1168] with a radius of 0.1168. Perform a CutFeatureOperation with a sketch scale of 0.2335, and an extrude depth opposite normal of 0.035. The resulting shape should be a cylindrical hole with a height of approximately 0.035 units, a bottom diameter of approximately 0.2736 units (0.1168 * 2) and a top slightly tapered due to the cut operation. The final overall dimensions of the rectangular metal bracket, after part 2's features are applied, would remain approximately 0.5 units (height) x 1 unit (width) x 0.75 units (length). Please note that these instructions are specifically for generating the provided CAD model, and other designs might require different instructions.</description>",
