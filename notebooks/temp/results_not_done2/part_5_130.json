The sides are parallel and the front face is slightly tilted. The dimensions are approximately 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height. The CAD Designer should note that this assembly has two parts, and the second part has a cut operation applied. This operation will create an angled front face on the finished assembly, making the front edge resemble a right triangle. The hypotenuse of the triangle will span the length of the part while the height of the triangle will be equal to the prism's height (approximately 1 unit).</description>",
