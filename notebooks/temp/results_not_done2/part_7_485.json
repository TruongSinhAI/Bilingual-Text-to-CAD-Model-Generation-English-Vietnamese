Draw a rectangle with the following vertices: * Vertex 1: [0.0, 0.0] * Vertex 2: [0.45, 0.0] * Vertex 3: [0.45, 0.45] * Vertex 4: [0.0, 0.45] **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.45. **Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector. **Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along its normal direction by a distance of 0.1125, and in the opposite direction by the same distance. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, with a length of 0.45, a width of 0.225, and a height of 0.45. Part 2: Cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, slightly tapered, and symmetrical along its central axis **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.45, 0.0967, 0.0898] **Step 2: Create the 2D sketch** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw a circle with the following properties: * Center: [0.1283, 0.1283] * Radius: 0.1283 **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.2566. **Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector. **Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along its normal direction by a distance of 0.3, and do not extrude in the opposite direction. This will create a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, slightly tapered, and symmetrical along its central axis, with a length of 0.3, a width of 0.2566, and a height of 0.2566. Final shape: Cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, positioned on a square base To create the final shape, join the two parts constructed above. The final cylindrical object will be positioned on a square base, with a square face on the bottom and a circular face on the top. The length and width of the square base will be 0.45, and the height of the cylinder will be 0.3 + 0.1125 = 0.4125. The radius of the circular face on the top will be the same as the radius of the circle drawn in part 2.</description>",
