The top and bottom sections are parallel to each other, while the middle section is slightly narrower than the top and bottom sections. The sides of the prism are straight and perpendicular to the top and bottom sections. The prism is centered in the image. The prism has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.0788 m * Width: 0.75 m * Height: 0.0788 m To construct this part, follow the steps below: 1. Create a new coordinate system with the following Euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. 3. Draw a rectangle using the following lines: * Line 1: Starting point at [0.0, 0.0], ending point at [0.0417, 0.0] * Line 2: Starting point at [0.0417, 0.0], ending point at [0.0417, 0.0788] * Line 3: Starting point at [0.0417, 0.0788], ending point at [0.0, 0.0788] * Line 4: Starting point at [0.0, 0.0788], ending point at [0.0, 0.0] This results in a rectangle with vertices at (0,0), (0.0417,0), (0.0417,0.0788), (0,0.0788).

Extrude the rectangular sketch to a depth of 0.75 m towards the normal, and a depth of 0 m opposite the normal. This results in a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The top and bottom sections are parallel to each other, while the middle section is slightly narrower than the top and bottom sections. The sides of the prism are straight and perpendicular to the top and bottom sections. The prism is centered in the image. The final shape is a rectangular prism as described above.</description>",
