The description clarifies that this rotation is applied as part of the 3D transformation, which is consistent with the coordinate system definition.\\n--The Translation Vector [0.0, 0.3285, 0.0] matches the JSON value.

It is mentioned in step 4 as a scaling factor and also implicitly as a parameter for extrusion in step 5.\\n--The `operation` is inferred as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\", which correctly reflects the generation of a new 3D model.\\n\\n-Correction: All inferred data from the description, including coordinate system, sketch geometry, and extrusion parameters, perfectly align with the JSON structure and values.
