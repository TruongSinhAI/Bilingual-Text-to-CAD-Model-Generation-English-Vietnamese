This will serve as the origin for the first intermediate part. Now, create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Within this sketch, there are four faces. - Face 1: This face consists of four loops (loop_1, loop_2, loop_3, loop_4) and each loop consists of one curve. - Loop 1: This loop consists of one arc, arc_1. The start point of this arc is at [0.0, 0.3163], the mid point is at [0.3163, 0.0], and the end point is at [0.6325, 0.3163]. - Loop 2: This loop consists of one line, line_1.

After creating the 2D sketch, scale it using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model. Use an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.0879 and no extrusion in the opposite direction. The sketch scale should also be set to 0.75. This will create the first intermediate part, which is a three-dimensional, cylindrical shape with a flat, rectangular base. The shape is symmetrical and has a smooth, curved surface. It appears to be a solid object with a hollow center. The length and width of this part are 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0879 units.</description>",
