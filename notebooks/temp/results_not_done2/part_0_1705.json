necessary) from Step 1:- Part 1 (Rectangular Prism with Sloped Side):    - Coordinate system and translation vector match.    - The sketch defines `face_1` with `loop_1` containing five lines. The start and end points of these lines are accurately represented in the JSON and form a closed loop.    - Extrusion parameters (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`, `operation`) exactly match the description. All values are correct.- Part 2 (Rectangular Prism):    - Coordinate system and translation vector match.    - The sketch defines `face_1` with `loop_1` containing four lines. The start and end points of these lines are accurately represented in the JSON and form a closed rectangular loop.    - Extrusion parameters (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`, `operation`) exactly match the description. All values are correct.- Part 3 (Three Cylindrical Objects):    - Coordinate system and translation vector match.    - The description states \"\n            ,\"Create a new sketch on the XY plane\"\n            ,\" three times, followed by defining a circle. The JSON correctly interprets this as three separate faces (`face_1`, `face_2`, `face_3`), each with a `loop_1` containing a `circle_1`. The centers and radii for all three circles are precisely matched.    - Extrusion parameters (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`, `operation`) exactly match the description. All values are correct.Correction: The inferred data is accurate and does not require further modifications.</think>"
