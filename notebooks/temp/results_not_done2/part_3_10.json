A loop cannot consist of both a line and an arc or a circle. - The euler angles of the coordinate system represent the 3D rotation of the 2D sketch plane, while the translation vector represents the translation of the 2D sketch plane. - The extrusion depth towards the normal and opposite normal, sketch scale, and operation are provided in the extrusion component of each part in the CAD assembly JSON. - The description component of each part in the CAD assembly JSON contains the shape of the CAD part, length, width, and height.
