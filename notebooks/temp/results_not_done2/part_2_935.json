    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom Begin by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles are set to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is set to [0.0972, 0.6818, 0.0702]. This will define the orientation and location of the part. Next, create the first face of the sketch. This face will be defined by a single loop, which in turn will be defined by multiple line segments. The first line segment (line\\\\_1) starts at point [0.0, 0.0] and ends at point [0.1375, 0.0029]. The second line segment (line\\\\_2) starts at point [0.1375, 0.0029] and ends at point [0.094, 0.1186]. The third line segment (line\\\\_3) starts at point [0.094, 0.1186] and ends at point [0.0815, 0.0544]. The fourth line segment (line\\\\_4) starts at point [0.0815, 0.0544] and ends at point [0.0625, 0.0544]. The fifth line segment (line\\\\_5) starts at point [0.0625, 0.0544] and ends at point [0.0425, 0.12]. The sixth line segment (line\\\\_6) starts at point [0.0425, 0.12] and ends at point [0.0, 0.0]. This loop forms a closed shape, as it starts and ends at the same point. Next, scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter sketch\\\\_scale, which is set to 0.1375. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal direction is 0.6818 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal direction is 0.0. The final shape is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The height is approximately twice the width, and the length of the shorter side is about half the length of the longer side. The length, width, and height of the shape are 0.1375, 0.6818, and 0.1375 units, respectively.</description>",
