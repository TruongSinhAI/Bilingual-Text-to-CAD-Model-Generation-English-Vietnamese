Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.375]. For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and a single loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face. On this loop, create a circle (circle\\\\_1) with a center at [0.0844, 0.0844] and a radius of 0.0844. After the sketch is complete, proceed to extrude it. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.1875 and the sketch scale to 0.1687. This will result in a final shape with a length of approximately 0.1687, a width of approximately 0.1687, and a height of 0.1875. **Instructions for Part 2:** Construct another cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.0019, 0.0019, 0.5625]. For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and a single loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face. On this loop, create a circle (circle\\\\_1) with a center at [0.0825, 0.0825] and a radius of 0.0825. After the sketch is complete, proceed to extrude it. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.1875 and the sketch scale to 0.165. This will result in a final shape with a length of approximately 0.165, a width of approximately 0.165, and a height of 0.1875. **Instructions for Part 3:** Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, connected by a curved surface. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 180.0] and a translation vector of [0.0234, 0.1453, 0.375]. For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and a single loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face. On this loop, create a circle (circle\\\\_1) with a center at [0.0609, 0.0609] and a radius of 0.0609. After the sketch is complete, proceed to extrude it. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.375 and the sketch scale to 0.1219. This will result in a final shape with a length of approximately 0.1219, a width of approximately 0.1219, and a height of 0.375. Once all three parts are complete, they will combine to form the final shape: a cylindrical object with a tapered end, resembling a pipe or tube. The height of the final shape is the sum of the heights of the three parts, or approximately 0.75. The length and width of the final shape are equal to the length and width of the largest part, or approximately 0.1687.</description>",
