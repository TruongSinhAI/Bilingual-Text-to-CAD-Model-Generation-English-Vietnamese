Sketch for face 1: Create a loop with 4 arcs. * Arc 1: Start at (0.3186, 0), midpoint at (0.375, 0.0523), end at (0.4314, 0) * Arc 2: Start at (0.4314, 0), midpoint at (0.75, 0.3707), end at (0.4314, 0.7415) * Arc 3: Start at (0.4314, 0.7415), midpoint at (0.375, 0.6892), end at (0.3186, 0.7415) * Arc 4: Start at (0.3186, 0.7415), midpoint at (0, 0.3707), end at (0.3186, 0) Sketch for face 2: Create a loop with 8 arcs, following the same sequence as the arcs in face 1. Additionally, create a circle at the center of these arcs with a radius of 0.1767. Sketch for face 3: Create two loops from the same circle. The first loop should have one circle, and the second loop should have one circle with a smaller radius, 0.0919. Now, transform the 2D sketches into 3D sketches using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketches to generate the 3D model. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.212 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal to 0.0, and apply a sketch scale of 0.75 to the sketch. This final shape will have a length and width of approximately 0.75, and a height of approximately 0.212. The operation to generate this shape is a \"New Body Feature Operation.\"</description>",
