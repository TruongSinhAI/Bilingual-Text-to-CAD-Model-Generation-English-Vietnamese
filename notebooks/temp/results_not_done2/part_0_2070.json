However, its value is present in the JSON.\\n\\n-Part 1:\\n  - Coordinate system matches.\\n  - Sketch: The description states \\\"Face 1\\\" with loop 1 and then \\\"Face 2\\\" with loop 2.

The JSON for `part_2` has `face_3` but it *only* contains the rectangle as `loop_1`. The circle described (\\\"Draw a circle centered at (0.4665, 0.2613) with a radius of 0.0424\\\") is *missing* from the JSON for `part_2`. Additionally, the JSON for `part_2` `face_2` has two loops, `loop_1` and `loop_2`, but the description for \\\"Face 2\\\" only lists one loop, implying it's just the outer boundary. The JSON for `part_2` also has an extra `face_3` with `loop_1` that's not explicitly described, and the *described* Face 3's circle is missing. This part has significant discrepancies.\\n  - Extrusion operation matches.\\n\\n-Part 3:\\n  - Coordinate system matches.\\n  - Sketch: `face_1` with `loop_1` matches the described rectangle.\\n  - Extrusion operation matches.\\n\\n-Correction:\\n  - For Part 1, the description implies two distinct faces (Face 1 and Face 2), but the JSON puts both loops under a single `face_1`. This is a structural discrepancy.\\n  - For Part 2, the description mentions a circle in \\\"Face 3\\\" which is absent from the JSON. Also, the JSON for Part 2 has a `face_3` with a rectangle loop that is not explicitly described in the text, and the description's \\\"Face 2\\\" section implies one loop while the JSON has two loops for `face_2`. These are significant mismatches in geometry.\\n  - Because of these significant discrepancies in `Part 1`'s face structure and `Part 2`'s missing/extra geometry, the JSON does not fully match the description.</think>"

After creating the 2D sketch, scale it using the sketch_scale parameter: 0.75 Now, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch by applying the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use an extrude depth towards the normal of 0.0017 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. The final height (or extrusion depth) of this part is 0.0017 units. The length and width are both 0.75 units.
