The prism is slightly tilted to the right. The dimensions of the prism are 0.4187 units in length, 0.2731 units in width, and 0.4187 units in height. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.2731, 0.0]. Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Sketch a rectangle by drawing four lines. Name the lines line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, and line\\\\_4. The details of the lines and loops are as follows: - line\\\\_1: Start point [0.0, 0.0], End point [0.1711, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start point [0.1711, 0.0], End point [0.1711, 0.4173] - line\\\\_3: Start point [0.1711, 0.4173], End point [0.0, 0.4187] - line\\\\_4: Start point [0.0, 0.4187], End point [0.0, 0.0] The loop, consisting of lines line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, and line\\\\_4, forms the boundary of the rectangle. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.4187. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector set earlier.

Step 4: Perform a Cut Feature Boolean Operation Extrude the 2D square sketch vertically by a distance of 0.0288 units along the negative Z-axis, performing a cut operation on the existing rectangular prism.</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description clearly defines two parts: \\\"Part 1: Construction of a Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism\\\" and \\\"Part 2: Cutting a Square Out of the Rectangular Prism\\\".\\n\\npart_1:\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description: \\\"Rotate the sketch about the Z-axis by an angle of 0°, the Y-axis by 0°, and the X-axis by 0°, using Euler angles.\\\")\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description: \\\"Perform a 3D translation using the translation vector (0,0,0).\\\")\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1:\\n    - loop_1: A closed loop made of 4 lines forming a rectangle:\\n      - line_1: Starting at (0,0), end at (0.75,0) (from description)\\n      - line_2: Starting at (0.75,0), end at (0.75,0.6923) (from description)\\n      - line_3: Starting at (0.75,0.6923), end at (0,0.6923) (from description)\\n      - line_4: Starting at (0,0.6923), end at (0,0) (from description)\\n- extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0288 (from description: \\\"Extrude the 2D sketch vertically by a distance of 0.0288 units along the positive Z-axis\\\")\\n  - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (inferred, as only positive extrusion is mentioned)\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.75 (from description: \\\"Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.75\\\")\\n  - operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (inferred, as it's the initial construction of a prism)\\n\\npart_2:\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 180.0] (from description: \\\"Euler angles for this coordinate system are (0°, 0°, 180°)\\\")\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.2019, 0.5192, 0.0] (from description: \\\"Translation vector should be (0.2019, 0.5192, 0)\\\")\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1:\\n    - loop_1: A closed loop made of 4 lines forming a square:\\n      - line_1: Starting at (0,0), end at (0.3462,0) (from description)\\n      - line_2: Starting at (0.3462,0), end at (0.3462,0.3462) (from description)\\n      - line_3: Starting at (0.3462,0.3462), end at (0,0.3462) (from description)\\n      - line_4: Starting at (0,0.3462), end at (0,0) (from description)\\n- extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0 (inferred, as extrusion is along the negative Z-axis)\\n  - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0288 (from description: \\\"Extrude the 2D square sketch vertically by a distance of 0.0288 units along the negative Z-axis\\\")\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.3462 (from description: \\\"Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.3462\\\")\\n  - operation: \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" (from description: \\\"performing a cut operation\\\")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n- Part 1 Coordinate System: Euler angles and translation vector match the JSON exactly.\\n- Part 1 Sketch:\\n  - Loop 1 lines: All start and end points of line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4 match the JSON precisely.
