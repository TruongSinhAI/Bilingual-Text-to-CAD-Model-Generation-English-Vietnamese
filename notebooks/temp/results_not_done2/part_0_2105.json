Operation: join with previous solid bodies **Construct the third part, a cylindrical object centered along the length of the prism.** Create a new coordinate system at (0.1199, 0.1163, 0.2978) with no rotation. Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Within the sketch, on face #1, create a circle centered at (0.0503, 0.0503) with a radius of 0.0503. On face #2, create a circle centered at (0.0503, 0.1908) with a radius of 0.0477. On face #3, create a circle centered at (0.0503, 0.3318) with a radius of 0.0473. Close the loop and complete the sketch as just three circles (one on each face). Exit the sketch and create an extrusion with the following properties: 1. Extrude depth towards normal: 0.2127 2. Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 3. Sketch scale: 0.3791 4.
