    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: A Rectangular Prism** The first part of the CAD model is a rectangular prism. **Step 1: Create the Coordinate System** 1. Define the euler angles as [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees. This will position the prism diagonally from the bottom left to the top right corner of the image. 2. Define the translation vector as [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. This will move the prism up by 0.75 units. **Step 2: Create the Sketch** 1. Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a rectangle using the following lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.25, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.25, 0.0], End Point [0.25, 0.25] - Line 3: Start Point [0.25, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.25] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.0] **Step 3: Extrude the Sketch** 1. Extrude the sketch by 0.75 units in the direction of the normal. 2. Set the sketch scale to 0.25. The final dimensions of the rectangular prism are: - Length: 0.25 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.25 units **Intermediate Part 2: A Cylindrical Hole** The second part of the CAD model is a cylindrical hole in the center of the rectangular prism. **Step 1: Create the Coordinate System** 1. Define the euler angles as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees. 2. Define the translation vector as [0.0, 0.0, -0.25]. This will move the cylinder up by 0.25 units, creating the hole effect. **Step 2: Create the Sketch** 1. Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a circle with a radius of 0.125 units. Place the center point of the circle at [0.125, 0.125] units. **Step 3: Extrude the Sketch** 1. Extrude the sketch by 0.25 units in the direction of the normal. 2. Set the sketch scale to 0.25. The final dimensions of the cylindrical hole are: - Length: 0.25 units - Width: 0.25 units - Height: 0.25 units (offset from the prism's height) **Combine the Parts** Use the \"IntersectFeatureOperation\" to combine the rectangular prism and the cylindrical hole. This will result in the final CAD model as described. The final shape has no overhanging parts or open faces. The final CAD model has the following combined dimensions: - Length: 0.25 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.25 units (offset from the prism's height)</description>",

Face 1 On this face, create a loop consisting of the following lines: * Line 1: Start Point: [0.0, 0.0], End Point: [0.75, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point: [0.75, 0.0], End Point: [0.75, 0.75] * Line 3: Start Point: [0.75, 0.75], End Point: [0.5625, 0.75] * Line 4: Start Point: [0.5625, 0.75], End Point: [0.0, 0.1875] * Line 5: Start Point: [0.0, 0.1875], End Point: [0.0, 0.0] Extrusion Extrude the sketch by 0.375 units in the positive Z-direction (towards the normal). Scale the sketch by 0.75 before extruding.
