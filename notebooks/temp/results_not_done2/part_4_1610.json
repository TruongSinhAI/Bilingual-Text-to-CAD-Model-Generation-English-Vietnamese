The prism has a flat bottom surface and is centered on a white background. The top edge is smooth and curves upwards, making the model symmetrical along the vertical axis. **1. Create a new coordinate system:** Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the Translation Vector to [0.0037, 0.061, 0.0261]. This determines the orientation and position of the 2D sketch plane. **2. Draw the 2D Sketch:** Create a new sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system.

Scale the 2D Sketch:** Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter of 0.7299. This determines the overall size of the 3D model. **4. Transform the 2D Sketch into 3D:** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector defined for this part. This gives the 2D sketch a third dimension, allowing it to be extruded. **5. Extrude the 2D Sketch:** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction with a depth of 0.061, and along the opposite direction of the normals by 0.0. This results in the final 3D model for this part. The shape has dimensions of approximately 0.73 units in length, 0.06 units in width, and 0.73 units in height.</description>",

Step 3: Transform 2D Sketch into 3D Sketch Scale the 2D sketch by the provided scaling factor of 0.75, and then transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector. Step 4: Extrude the 3D Sketch Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following properties: - Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.0057 - Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0 Part 1 Description As per the given description, this part is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. The prism has a flat top and bottom, and the cylindrical hole is centered along its length. The prism is slightly tapered towards both ends. The dimensions of this part are as follows: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.0057 - Height: 0.75 Follow the same instructions for creating other parts while replacing the shape, dimensions, and sketch information with the new data. Don't use boolean operation specific terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation' etc. Instead, use their natural language descriptions like \"create a new part\" or \"remove material\" when describing part integration between CAD models.</description>",
