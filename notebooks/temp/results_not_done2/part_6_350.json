Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. For the first sketch, draw a 2D profile on the XY plane (face_1). This sketch consists of a single loop (loop_1) and seven lines (line_1 to line_7). The loop is closed, starting with a horizontal line (line_1) from point [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0], followed by a vertical line (line_2) to [0.75, 0.25], then another horizontal line (line_3) to [0.25, 0.25], a vertical line (line_4) to [0.25, 0.75], a horizontal line (line_5) to [0.0, 0.75], and a final vertical line (line_6) back to [0.0, 0.25]. Complete the loop by drawing a horizontal line (line_7) back to the initial point [0.0, 0.0]. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 (sketch_scale), and then rotate it using the euler angles defined in the coordinate system. After that, transform the 2D sketch into 3D by extruding it along the Z-axis with an extrusion depth of 0.25 towards the normal and a depth of 0.0 in the opposite direction (extrude_depth_towards_normal and extrude_depth_opposite_normal parameters). This creates a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The dimensions of this part are as follows: the length is 0.75, the width is 0.75, and the height is 0.25 (including the tapered top and bottom). The overall height of the part is 1.0, considering the 0.75 height of the vertical sides plus the 0.25 height added by the extrusion for the top and bottom tapered areas. The final shape of this part corresponds to the description provided in the JSON: \"A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom.\"</description>",
