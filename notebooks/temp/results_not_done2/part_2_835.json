Close the loop by drawing a line connecting (0.0032, 0.1317) to (0.0032, 0.0933). 3. **Third face** Connect the points (0.0032, 0.0384), (0.7468, 0.0384), (0.7468, 0.0933) and (0.0032, 0.0933) to form a rectangle. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** Apply a uniform scaling of 0.75 to the entire sketch. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Using the provided euler angles and translation vector, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the sketch along the normal with a depth of 0.007 units and an equal depth in the opposite direction to create a solid feature. **Part 1 Completed** You have now created the first intermediate CAD part, a sloped rectangular prism. Remember to save your work before proceeding. *Part dimensions: Length: 0.75 units, Width: 0.014 units, Height: 0.75 units.*</description>",
