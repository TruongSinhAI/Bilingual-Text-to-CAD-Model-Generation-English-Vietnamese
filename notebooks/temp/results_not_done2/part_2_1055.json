The prism has dimensions of 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is centered on a white background. 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Sketching on the X-Y plane, draw a rectangle with the following vertices: - Vertex 1: [0.0, 0.0] - Vertex 2: [0.75, 0.0] - Vertex 3: [0.75, 0.2753] - Vertex 4: [0.0, 0.2753] The rectangle is defined by a single face with a single loop, which is composed of 4 line segments: - Line segment 1: Connecting Vertex 1 to Vertex 2 (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0) - Line segment 2: Connecting Vertex 2 to Vertex 3 (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.2753) - Line segment 3: Connecting Vertex 3 to Vertex 4 (0.75, 0.2753) to (0.0, 0.2753) - Line segment 4: Connecting Vertex 4 to Vertex 1 (0.0, 0.2753) to (0.0, 0.0) 2.

Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal direction by 0.0816 units (towards the positive side of the Z-axis). 5. Extrude the scaled sketch along the opposite direction of normal (negative direction of the Z-axis) by 0.0 units. This is essentially leaving the sketch unchanged in the opposite direction. The final shape of this part will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side, with dimensions 0.75 units in both length and width, and 0.0816 units in height, as specified by the provided scaling factors and extrusion depths.</description>",
