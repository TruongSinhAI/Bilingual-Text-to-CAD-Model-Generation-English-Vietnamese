    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism, with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal, and the top and bottom faces are slightly smaller than the sides. The middle section is slightly narrower than the top and bottom faces. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.75, 0.0). This will position the coordinate system for generating the prism. Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane Next, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the newly created coordinate system. The sketch should have a single face, with a loop that consists of four lines. The lines should be defined as follows: 1. Start point: (0.0, 0.0); End point: (0.75, 0.0) 2. Start point: (0.75, 0.0); End point: (0.75, 0.75) 3. Start point: (0.75, 0.75); End point: (0.0, 0.75) 4. Start point: (0.0, 0.75); End point: (0.0, 0.0) Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Set the sketch_scale parameter to 0.75 to scale the 2D sketch. Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Now, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by rotating it around the coordinate system and translating its position using the euler_angles and translation_vector provided. In this case, there's no need to rotate the sketch, as the euler angles are already set to the desired values. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Finally, set the extrusion depths (extrude_depth_towards_normal and extrude_depth_opposite_normal) to 0.75 and 0.0, respectively, to extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model. This will create the first part of the final shape, a three-dimensional rectangular prism. The length, width, and height of the prism are each 0.75 units.</description>",

Connections are correct and coordinates match.\\n  - Inner loops:\\n    - loop_2 (description's Loop 1): Arcs and lines form a closed shape. All coordinates and connections match the JSON.\\n    - loop_3 (description's Loop 2): Arcs and lines form a closed shape. All coordinates and connections match the JSON.\\n    - loop_4 (description's Loop 3): Circle definition matches the JSON.\\n    - loop_5 (description's Loop 4): Circle definition matches the JSON.\\n  - The mapping of description's \"\n            ,\"Loop 1\"\n            ,\" to JSON \"\n            ,\"loop_2\"\n            ,\" etc. is consistent as the description labels the outer rectangle as the primary shape and then lists \"\n            ,\"Next, create three arcs and two lines to form three loops inside the rectangle.
