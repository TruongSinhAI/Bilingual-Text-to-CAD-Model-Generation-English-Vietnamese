Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with no rotations. *Sketch:* Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. - Draw a circle with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375 for loop 1, face 1. The sketch is complete. *Extrusion:* With the complete sketch, perform an extrusion operation along the Z-axis. The depth toward the normal should be 0.045 units, and the depth opposite the normal should be 0. Scale the sketch by 0.75 before the extrusion operation. This step completes the construction for part 1, which results in a slightly tapered cylindrical object with a rectangular cross-section. *Dimensions:* The length and width are both 0.75 units, and the height is 0.045 units. **Part 2: Circular Object with a Central Hole** Create the second part using a new coordinate system. Translate the coordinate system to (0.075, 0.075, 0.045), while keeping the rotations at (0, 0, 0). *Sketch:* Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. - Draw the first circle with a center at (0.3, 0.3), and a radius of 0.3 for loop 1, face 1. - Draw the second circle with a center at (0.3, 0.3), and a radius of 0.225 for loop 2, face 1. - Draw the third circle with a center at (0.3, 0.3), and a radius of 0.15 for loop 1, face 2. - Draw the fourth circle with a center at (0.3, 0.3), and a radius of 0.075 for loop 2, face 2. *Extrusion:* Perform an extrusion operation along the Z-axis with the completed sketch. The depth toward the normal should be 0, and the depth opposite the normal should be 0.0225 units. Scale the sketch by 0.6 before the extrusion operation. This step completes the construction for the circular object with a central hole, resembling a target or bullseye. *Dimensions:* The length and width are both 0.6 units, and the height is 0.0225 units. These instructions provide guidance for building the given CAD assembly with accurate curves, loops, and faces. The junior CAD designer can follow these natural language instructions to generate the required CAD model without specific boolean operation terms.</description>",
