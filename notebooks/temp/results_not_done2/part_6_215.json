Here are the details: 1. circle\\\\_1's center is at (0.3248, 0.375) with a radius of 0.203. **Step 3: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Now, transform the 2D sketch with the given scaling and translation parameters. The euler angles are all 0°, so there's no need to perform any rotation. The scaling factor is 0.75 for all axes. **Step 4: Extrude the 3D model** Lastly, extrude the 2D sketch along the z-axis (towards the normal) by 0.3572 and do not extrude in the opposite direction. The final height of this part is 0.3572 as specified in the description. **Part dimension summary** Part 1: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.75 - Height (extrusion depth): 0.3572 This concludes the construction of part 1.
