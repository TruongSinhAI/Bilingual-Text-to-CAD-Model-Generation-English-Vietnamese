We will create a new coordinate system and proceed with the following steps: 1. *Creating coordinate system* Create a new coordinate system with the euler angles as (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translation vector (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). 2. *Drawing 2D sketch* - Begin by drawing a rectangle on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Divide the rectangle into two loops: - **Loop 1**: Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.5806, 0.0); then draw a line from point (0.5806, 0.0) to point (0.5806, 0.3387); then draw a line from point (0.5806, 0.3387) to point (0.0, 0.3387); and finally, connect the initial point (0.0, 0.3387) with the first point (0.0, 0.0) to close the loop. - **Loop 2**: At the center point (0.1452, 0.2661) of the rectangle, draw a circle with a radius of 0.0363. - Draw a second rectangle on the XY plane of the coordinate system, on top of the first rectangle. Divide this second rectangle into two loops: - **Loop 3**: Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.5806, 0.0); then draw a line from point (0.5806, 0.0) to point (0.5806, 0.0726); then draw a line from point (0.5806, 0.0726) to point (0.0, 0.0726); and finally, connect the initial point (0.0, 0.0726) with the first point (0.0, 0.0) to close the loop. - **Loop 4**: At the center point (0.4355, 0.0363) of this rectangle, draw a circle with a radius of 0.0363. 3. *Scaling 2D sketch* Scale the entire 2D sketch uniformly by a scaling factor of 0.5806 to accommodate the prism dimensions. 4. *Transforming the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch* Rotate the 2D sketch around the Z-axis of the coordinate system by no degrees, rotate the 2D sketch around the Y-axis of the coordinate system by no degrees, and rotate the 2D sketch around the X-axis of the coordinate system by no degrees. Translate the 2D sketch along the X-axis by no units, translate the 2D sketch along the Y-axis by no units, and translate the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by no units. 5. *Extruding the 2D sketch to generate 3D model* Extrude the 2D sketch along the extrusion normal with an extrusion depth of 0.0484 units. Do not perform any extrusion in the opposite direction. 6. *Finalizing part settings* As this part is added to the CAD model without any interaction with the previous parts, don't apply any boolean operation to this part. The `NewBodyFeatureOperation` operation is used to indicate this part's independence. Here are the dimensions of the intermediate CAD parts and the final CAD shape: - Part 1 dimensions: length 0.5806; width 0.5806; height 0.0484 - Final CAD shape dimensions: length - to be determined by the combination of all parts; width - to be determined by the combination of all parts; height - to be determined by the combination of all parts</description>",
