Step 2: Drawing the 2D Sketch Next, proceed to draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Step 3: Creating Faces and Loops 1. Create a new face (face\\\\_1) and within it, a loop (loop\\\\_1). 2. Add four line objects inside loop\\\\_1: a. line\\\\_1 with start point as (0.0, 0.0) and end point as (0.75, 0.0) b. line\\\\_2 with start point as (0.75, 0.0) and end point as (0.75, 0.125) c. line\\\\_3 with start point as (0.75, 0.125) and end point as (0.0, 0.5) d. line\\\\_4 with start point as (0.0, 0.5) and end point as (0.0, 0.0) Step 4: 3D Transformation and Extrusion With the 2D sketch completed, scale it by 0.75 along all axes and then transform the 2D sketch into 3D using a combination of rotation and translation defined by the coordinate system above. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with a depth of 0.125 toward the positive normal direction and another 0.125 in the opposite direction. Part 2: Formation of a Rectangular Prism with a Triangular Cutout Identical to Part 1, create a new coordinate system using the specified Euler angles and translation vector. Step 1: Drawing the 2D Sketch Draw two separate 2D sketches on the X-Y and X-Z planes, for two separate faces. Step 2: Creating Faces, Loops, and Lines (Face 1) 1.
