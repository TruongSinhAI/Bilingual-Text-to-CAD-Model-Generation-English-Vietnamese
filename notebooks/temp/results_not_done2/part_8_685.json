This will position the object slightly angled to the viewer. **Sketching the 2D Profile** Next, create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Create a single circle centered at [0.038, 0.038] with a radius of 0.038 units. This will be the top of the cylinder. **Extruding the Sketch to 3D** With the sketch complete, extrude it by 0.057 units towards the normal of the sketch plane and 0.0 units in the opposite direction. This will create the 3D cylindrical shape. The scaling parameter for the sketch is 0.0759. This completes the construction of part 1. **Instructions for Part 2** Construct a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat top and bottom. The hole is cylindrical with a flat bottom. The prism is centered on the white background and is positioned at an angle. **Sketching the 2D Profile** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.693, 0.0]. This will position the object at the desired location. Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Create a rectangle with two lines starting from [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.1139, 0.0] and [0.1139, 0.0] to [0.1139, 0.1139] and [0.1139, 0.1139] to [0.0, 0.1139] and [0.0, 0.1139] to [0.0, 0.0]. This will form the outer boundary of the prism. Create a circle centered at [0.057, 0.057] with a radius of 0.038 units. The circle should be completely contained within the rectangle. **Extruding the Sketch to 3D** With the sketch complete, extrude it by 0.6361 units towards the normal of the sketch plane and 0.0 units in the opposite direction. This will create the 3D prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The scaling parameter for the sketch is 0.1139. This completes the construction of part 2.</description>",
