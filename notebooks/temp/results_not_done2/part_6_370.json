This implies multiple, distinct extrusion operations or a boolean union of individually extruded shapes. The JSON, however, provides a single `extrusion` object with `extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.5`, which applies uniformly to the entire `face_1, loop_1`. This is a direct contradiction. The single extrusion operation in the JSON cannot create the complex extrusion defined in the description.\\n--Result: The extrusion parameters and conceptual application are inconsistent with the detailed instructions in the description.\\n\\n-Correction: The JSON does not accurately represent the described sketch structure and, more importantly, the multi-directional and selective extrusion operations outlined in the description.
