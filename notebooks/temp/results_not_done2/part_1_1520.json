The lines form a closed loop, ensuring valid geometry:\\n---line_1 ends at [0.0018, 0.0], which is the start of line_2.\\n---line_2 ends at [0.0018, 0.0143], which is the start of line_3.\\n---line_3 ends at [0.1946, 0.0143], which is the start of line_4.\\n---line_4 ends at [0.2661, 0.0], which is the start of line_5.\\n---line_5 ends at [0.2664, 0.0018], which is the start of line_6.\\n---line_6 ends at [0.1948, 0.0161], which is the start of line_7.\\n---line_7 ends at [0.0, 0.0161], which is the start of line_8.\\n---line_8 ends at [0.0, 0.0], which is the start of line_1.\\n--The loop is geometrically sound and matches the JSON.\\n\\n-Extrusion: The extrusion depth (0.75 towards normal), opposite depth (0.0), and sketch scale (0.2664) are directly from the description and are correct. The operation \"  \n  ,  \n  \"NewBodyFeatureOperation  \",  \n  \"   is explicitly stated and correctly matches the JSON.\\n\\n-Correction: All inferred data is accurate and consistent with the provided JSON.
