It has four faces, six edges, and eight vertices. The dimensions of the object are 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height. The object is centered on a white background. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Create a new coordinate system with the Euler Angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the Translation Vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0].

Step 3: Create the second face of the prism Create the second face of the prism by drawing a circle with a center at [0.0893, 0.6607] and a radius of 0.0286. Step 4: Create the third face of the prism Create the third face of the prism by performing the following operations: * Draw a line from point [0.1768, 0.0607] to point [0.2339, 0.0607]. * Draw an arc from point [0.2339, 0.0607] to point [0.2339, 0.1179] with a midpoint at [0.2625, 0.0893]. * Draw a line from point [0.2339, 0.1179] to point [0.1768, 0.1179]. * Draw an arc from point [0.1768, 0.1179] to point [0.1768, 0.0607] with a midpoint at [0.1482, 0.0893]. Step 5: Create the fourth face of the prism Create the fourth face of the prism by drawing a circle with a center at [0.6607, 0.0893] and a radius of 0.0286. Step 6: Scale the sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Step 7: Extrude the sketch Extrude the sketch by 0.2268 units towards the normal and 0.0 units opposite the normal. This will give you the final shape.</description>",
