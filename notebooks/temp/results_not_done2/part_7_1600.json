Sketching the Base Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system and draw two rectangles side by side, each having two parallel sides of length 0.4086 units and two parallel sides of length 0.75 units. * For the first rectangle, draw a line from [0.0, 0.0] to [0.4086, 0.0]. Then, draw a line from [0.4086, 0.0] to [0.4086, 0.75]. Next, draw a line from [0.4086, 0.75] to [0.0, 0.75]. Finally, close the loop by drawing a line from [0.0, 0.75] back to [0.0, 0.0]. * For the second rectangle, repeat the same process but ensure the lines are connected to the first rectangle's endpoints. The sketch contains two rectangles with both loops having four lines each. These loops form two faces of the rectangular prism. 2. Scaling and Extruding the Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0286].

Sketching the Groove Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system and draw a rectangle inside part 1. The rectangle should have two parallel sides of length 0.3979 units and two parallel sides of length 0.7393 units. * Draw a line from [0.0, 0.0] to [0.3979, 0.0].

The sketch contains one rectangle with four lines. This loop forms one side of the rectangular groove. 2. Cutting and Adjusting the Depth Cut the sketch from part 1. Transform the cut 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0054, 0.0054, 0.0286]. Adjust the depth of the cut by extruding it by -0.0232 units in the opposite direction of the normal (Z-axis).
