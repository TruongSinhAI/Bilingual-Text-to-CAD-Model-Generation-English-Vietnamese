    "prompt": "<description>** Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler Angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.375, 0.0, 0.0]. This will position the sketch in the correct orientation and location. Now, let's move on to the sketching stage. The sketch will be drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of one face, and this face contains one loop. Face 1: * Loop 1: + Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.5, 0.0] + Line 2: Start Point [0.5, 0.0], End Point [0.5, 0.5] + Line 3: Start Point [0.5, 0.5], End Point [0.0, 0.0] The loop forms a triangle. It is important to note that the loop is closed since its start and end points are the same. Now, let's move on to the extrusion stage. We'll be using the extrusion depth values of 0.1875 towards the normal and 0.1875 opposite the normal. Additionally, we'll apply a sketch scale of 0.5. Extrusion: * Extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1875 * Extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.1875 * Sketch_scale: 0.5 * Operation: Create a new solid body This extrusion will make the 2D sketch a 3D solid geometry. ** Part 2: Three-dimensional geometric shape with a flat base and a triangular top, connected by a straight line** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.375, 0.0, 0.0] This will position the sketch correctly.
