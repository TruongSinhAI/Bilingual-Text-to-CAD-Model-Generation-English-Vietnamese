Also, the description misses the 8th line necessary to close the loop defined in the JSON. Thus, the description for `face_2` is incomplete compared to the JSON.\\n\\n-Extrusion parameters: `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, and `sketch_scale` values match the JSON. The operation is correctly inferred as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\".\\n\\n-Correction: The description for `face_2` is incomplete as it states 7 lines and omits the 8th line (`line_8`) required to form the closed loop as defined in the JSON. This makes the description not fully match the JSON.\\n\\n</think>"
