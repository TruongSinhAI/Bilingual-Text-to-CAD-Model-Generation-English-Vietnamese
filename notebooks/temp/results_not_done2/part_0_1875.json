    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Construct a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom.** **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** The coordinate system for this part should have the following euler angles and translation vector: Euler Angles: [ -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 ] Translation Vector: [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] **Step 2: Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane** This sketch will be the base for the 3D model. **Step 3: Draw the curves for the sketch** The sketch consists of the following curves: * One line from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.2054, 0.0) * One line from (0.2054, 0.0) to (0.2054, 0.75) * One arc from (0.2054, 0.75) to (0.1429, 0.6875) with a center at (0.1612, 0.7317) * One line from (0.1429, 0.6875) to (0.1429, 0.5472) * One arc from (0.1429, 0.5472) to (0.127, 0.5055) with a center at (0.1388, 0.5249) * One arc from (0.127, 0.5055) to (0.0015, 0.2604) with a center at (0.0484, 0.391) * One arc from (0.0015, 0.2604) to (0.0, 0.2469) with a center at (0.0004, 0.2537) * One line from (0.0, 0.2469) to (0.0, 0.0) **Step 4: Constrain the sketch** The sketch should be constrained as follows: * Each loop is closed * The first line and the last line form a line loop * The other loops are arc loops **Step 5: Scale the sketch** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 **Step 6: Transform the sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. **Step 7: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.4375 units. **Step 8: Finalize the part** The final part is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom. It has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.4375 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.75</description>",
