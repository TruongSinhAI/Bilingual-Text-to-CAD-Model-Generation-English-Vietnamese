The front face is angled at 45 degrees from the top and bottom faces. The sides are parallel to each other and the top and bottom faces. The object is centered in the image. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0134, 0.0] Now, we shall create the initial 2D sketch on face 1: 1. Create an arc with the following attributes: - Start Point: [0.0, 0.0] - End Point: [0.75, 0.0] - Mid Point: [0.375, 0.2165] 2. Create a line joining the previous arc's end point to [0.75, 0.0429]. 3. Create a line joining [0.75, 0.0429] to [0.0, 0.0429]. 4. Create a line joining [0.0, 0.0429] to the original arc's start point. Note that this loop has 1 arc and 3 lines, creatig a face with a 45-degree angle. Now, we will create the sketch for face 2: 1.

Continue the arc by creating a line from its end point to [0.0, 0.3857]. 4. Complete the loop by creating a line from [0.0, 0.3857] to [0.0, 0.0429]. The second loop in face 2 has 1 arc and 3 lines.

Transform the sketches into 3D Sketches using the coordinate system defined earlier. After, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following properties: - Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.0067 units towards the normal and the opposite direction - Set sketch_scale to 0.75 The first intermediate CAD part is complete, which together with subsequent parts will form the final cad model: - Shape: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.
