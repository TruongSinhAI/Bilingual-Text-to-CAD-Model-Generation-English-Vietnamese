However, in the JSON, \"\n    ,\"face_1\"\n    ,\" and \"\n    ,\"face_2\"\n    ,\" are contained within a single \"\n    ,\"sketch\"\n    ,\" object. For a standard 2D sketch used for extrusion, all elements within that sketch must reside on a single plane. Therefore, having loops defined on both the XY and XZ planes within a single sketch for extrusion, as implied by the JSON structure where both \"\n    ,\"face_1\"\n    ,\" and \"\n    ,\"face_2\"\n    ,\" are under one \"\n    ,\"sketch\"\n    ,\" object, contradicts the description's assertion of different planes for different faces/loops of the *same* sketch. This makes the description inconsistent with the typical interpretation of the JSON sketch structure.\\n  - Result: Inconsistent due to sketch plane definition.\\n\\n-Overall Result: Due to the inconsistency in the sketch plane description, the overall validity is No.\\n</think>"
