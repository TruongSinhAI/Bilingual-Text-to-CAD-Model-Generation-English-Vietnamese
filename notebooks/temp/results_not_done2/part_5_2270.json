Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0187, 0.0]. Now, let's create the 2D sketch for the first part. The sketch is composed of a single face (face_1) and has two loops (loop_1 and loop_2). Loop_1 is a circle centered at [0.375, 0.375] with a radius of 0.375. Loop_2 is a quadrilateral formed by the following lines: - Line_1: Start Point [0.3562, 0.3312], End Point [0.3938, 0.3312] - Line_2: Start Point [0.3938, 0.3312], End Point [0.3938, 0.4188] - Line_3: Start Point [0.3938, 0.4188], End Point [0.3562, 0.4188] - Line_4: Start Point [0.3562, 0.4188], End Point [0.3562, 0.3312] After creating the 2D sketch, scale it using the scaling parameter sketch_scale, which is 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the provided euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal by 0.0094 units and in the opposite direction by the same amount to create the 3D model. This constitutes the first part of the CAD assembly. The length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.0187 units, and the height is 0.75 units. These measurements are relative to the scaling parameter and the extrusion depth. The central hole in the object is smaller than the outer circumference, and the object has a flat surface. It is a two-dimensional representation made of a solid material.</description>",
