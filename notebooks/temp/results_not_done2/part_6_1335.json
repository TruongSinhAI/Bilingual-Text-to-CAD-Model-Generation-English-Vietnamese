The euler angles are set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector is also set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 2D Sketch Create the 2D sketch for the first face of the prism on the XY plane of the coordinate system. * Line 1: Draw a line starting from point [0.0296, 0.0] extending to point [0.7204, 0.0]. * Arc 1: Draw an arc starting from point [0.7204, 0.0] with a midpoint at [0.75, 0.0296] and ending at [0.7204, 0.0592]. * Line 2: Draw a line starting from point [0.7204, 0.0592] extending to point [0.0296, 0.0592]. * Arc 2: Draw an arc starting from point [0.0296, 0.0592] with a midpoint at [0.0, 0.0296] and ending at the starting point [0.0296, 0.0]. This sketch has two loops, each with two lines and two arcs. The first loop consists of Line 1, Arc 1, Line 2, and Arc 2, drawn clockwise. This completes the 2D sketch for the first face of the prism. Extrusion The 2D sketch will be transformed into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. The sketch will then be extruded to generate the 3D model for the prism. * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.0123 * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 * Sketch Scale: 0.75 The type of boolean operation in this case is \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" which simply creates a new solid body without affecting any preceding bodies. In this particular example, the long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.0123 You should continue constructing the rest of the CAD model according to the provided JSON, following the same format and tone for each part and its components.</description>",
