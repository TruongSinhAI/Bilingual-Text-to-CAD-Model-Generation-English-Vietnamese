Create an arc (arc-1) with a start point at [0.0, 0.1326], mid point at [0.122, 0.0], and an end point at [0.244, 0.1326]. 2. Create a line (line-1) from the end point of arc-1 to [0.2108, 0.5304]. 3. Create an arc (arc-2) with a start point at [0.2108, 0.5304], mid point at [0.2268, 0.577], and an end point at [0.2718, 0.5967]. 4. Create a line (line-2) from the end point of arc-2 to [0.4587, 0.5967]. 5. Create an arc (arc-3) with a start point at [0.4587, 0.5967], mid point at [0.5353, 0.6734], and an end point at [0.4587, 0.75]. 6. Create a line (line-3) from the end point of arc-3 to [0.122, 0.75]. 7. Create an arc (arc-4) with a start point at [0.122, 0.75], mid point at [0.0701, 0.7298], and an end point at [0.0456, 0.6797]. 8. Create a line (line-4) from the end point of arc-4 to the start point of arc-1. **Step 4: Adding constraints to the first loop** 1. Close the loop created by arc-1, line-1, arc-2, line-2, arc-3, line-3, and arc-4. 2. Ensure that all curves are tangent to each other. **Step 5: Creating additional loops for the holes** 1. Create a circle (circle-1) with its center at [0.122, 0.1224] and a radius of 0.0306 for the first hole. 2. Create a circle (circle-1) with its center at [0.122, 0.6734] and a radius of 0.0306 for the second hole. 3. Close and constrain the loops for the holes. **Step 6: Scaling the 2D sketch** Scale the entire 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 7: Creating the 3D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch in the direction of the normal by a distance of 0.0306 to create a 3D model. The height of the part is the same as its length, which is 0.75 units. The width is 0.0306 units. **Note:** The resulting part is the first part of a rectangular metal bracket with two holes on the top edge. The part is created as a new solid body and ready for further assembly or modification. **Proceed to the next part as required by the assembly process.**</description>",
