The JSON structure for `extrusion` under `part_1` only supports *one* extrusion operation with a `towards_normal` and `opposite_normal` depth. It does not account for two separate sketches being extruded and then joined. Therefore, the JSON's single `extrusion` block with `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0` does not fully represent the description's instruction to extrude a *second sketch* by 0.0025 units in the negative Z direction and then join them.\\n  - `operation`: The description states \"\n        ,\"Combine the two extrusions using a 'JoinFeatureOperation'\",\n        \", but the JSON specifies \"\n        ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\",\n        \".
