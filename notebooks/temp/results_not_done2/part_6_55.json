This will define the orientation and position of the part. Step 2: Draw 2D sketch for the top surface 1.

The JSON has only one `extrusion` block for `part_1`.

A simple linear extrusion, as implied by the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` parameters in the JSON, would not typically create a 'curved surface' in the context of a cylindrical object from such a profile, unless it's a specific, unusual application or a thin-walled extrusion from a cross-section. The JSON's extrusion type (linear extrusion) does not fully align with the typical CAD operation for forming a \"  , \"curved surface  \"  , \" from an arc/line profile within a \"  , \"cylindrical object  \"  , \" that is usually formed by revolution or sweeping.
