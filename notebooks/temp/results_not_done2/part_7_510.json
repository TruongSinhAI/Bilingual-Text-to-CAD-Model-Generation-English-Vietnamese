Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.3 units. The resulting prism has a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.3 units as described. Part 2 (following part with no explicit JSON provided): Let's proceed with the next part of the CAD model, assuming that the JSON for part 2 is properly formatted and provided is similar to the previous example. Construct a cylindrical shape. Begin by creating a new coordinate system similar to before. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to appropriate values based on the desired positioning of the cylinder. Next, create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane, similar to the prism, but this time drawing a circle with a center point at [0.0, 0.0], and a radius matching the desired dimensions. Since the sketch is a circle, there is only one loop and one curve. Now, scale the 2D sketch if necessary, and transform it similar to the previous part. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to create the cylindrical shape. Provide an appropriate depth based on the desired height of the cylinder.
