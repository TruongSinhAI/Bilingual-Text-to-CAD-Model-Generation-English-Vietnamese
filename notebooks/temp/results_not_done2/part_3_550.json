Final Shape The final shape describes a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. The prism has a flat top and bottom, and the cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of approximately 0.5 units.</description>",

Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles and the translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following properties: - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0363 - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 This completes the construction of the first part. The length is 0.6811, width is 0.6811 and height is 0.0363. Now proceed to construct the subsequent parts, following the same process and using the CAD Assembly JSON as reference. Clearly distinguish each part's instructions by tagging them with the corresponding part number.</description>",
