Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0, 0, 0) with no rotation. 1. **Face 1:** - Draw a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.375. This will create the outer boundary of the base. 2. **Face 2:** - Draw another circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.2297. This will create the inner boundary of the base. Next, we will extrude these sketches. 1. Extrude **Face 1** by 0.0281 units towards the normal. 2. Extrude **Face 2** by 0.0281 units towards the normal. The result is a cylindrical base with a central hole. Part 2: Middle Section of the Cylindrical Object Construct the middle section of the cylindrical object. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0.1453, 0.1453, 0) with no rotation. 1. **Face 1:** - Draw a circle centered at (0.2297, 0.2297) with a radius of 0.2297. This will create the outer boundary of the middle section. 2. Extrude **Face 1** by 0.2812 units towards the normal. Next, we will intersect the middle section with the base to create the tapered effect. 1. Use the 'IntersectFeatureOperation' to intersect the middle section with the base. The result is a middle section that gradually tapers towards the bottom of the object. Part 3: Top of the Cylindrical Object Construct the top of the cylindrical object. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0, 0, 0) with no rotation. 1. **Face 1:** - Draw a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.375. This will create the outer boundary of the top. 2. **Face 2:** - Draw another circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.2297. This will create the inner boundary of the top. Next, we will extrude these sketches. 1. Extrude **Face 1** by 0.0281 units towards the normal. 2. Extrude **Face 2** by 0.0281 units towards the normal. The result is a cylindrical top with a central hole. To combine all the parts, use the 'JoinFeatureOperation' to join the base, middle section, and top together. The final object is a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. It has a central hole and a smaller hole on the top.
