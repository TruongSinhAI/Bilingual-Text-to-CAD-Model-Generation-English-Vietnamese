This is a mismatch.  -Sketch (face_2.loop_1): The description is truncated for `arc_2`. It mentions \\\"Midpoint at [0.0937, 0.0\\\" but the JSON has `[0.0937, 0.0469]` for mid point and a specified end point. This indicates an incomplete and potentially inaccurate description for this arc's midpoint and missing endpoint compared to JSON.  -Sketch (face_3): The description completely lacks information for `face_3`, but it exists in the JSON.  -Extrusion: The description provides no details for the extrusion of Part 2, whereas the JSON includes full extrusion parameters (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`, `operation`). This is a significant omission in the description.-Correction:  -For Part 1, the description should accurately state \\\"four lines\\\" instead of \\\"three lines\\\" for `loop_1` in `face_1`.  -For Part 2, the description for `face_1.loop_1.arc_2` midpoint should be `[0.0, 0.2841]` to match JSON.  -For Part 2, the description for `face_2.loop_1.arc_2` is incomplete and potentially inaccurate. It needs completion and correction to match JSON's `Mid Point\\\":[0.0937,0.0469],\\\"End Point\\\":[0.0469,0.0]}`.  -The description needs to include details for `face_3` in Part 2.  -The description needs to include the complete extrusion parameters for Part 2 to match the JSON's `{\\\"extrude_depth_towards_normal\\\":0.0,\\\"extrude_depth_opposite_normal\\\":0.0938,\\\"sketch_scale\\\":0.5612,\\\"operation\\\":\\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\"}`.
