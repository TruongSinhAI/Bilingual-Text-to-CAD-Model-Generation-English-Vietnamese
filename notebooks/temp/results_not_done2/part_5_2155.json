This is an error in the description. For the JSON to be `Yes` valid, the description should accurately reflect a radius of 0.136 for the inner circle.

Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin \\\\([0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\\\\) with no rotations. Step 2: Create the 2D sketch For the base, create a 2D sketch in the X-Y plane called \"face\\\\_1\". Within this sketch, create a loop composed of four lines, as follows: 1. Draw a line (line\\\\_1) from \\\\([0.0, 0.0]\\\\) to \\\\([0.0234, 0.0]\\\\). 2. Draw a line (line\\\\_2) from \\\\([0.0234, 0.0]\\\\) to \\\\([0.0234, 0.0156]\\\\). 3. Draw a line (line\\\\_3) from \\\\([0.0234, 0.0156]\\\\) to \\\\([0.0, 0.0156]\\\\). 4. Draw a line (line\\\\_4) from \\\\([0.0, 0.0156]\\\\) to \\\\([0.0, 0.0]\\\\). This loop forms a rectangle, with two parallel sides along the X-axis (horizontal) and two parallel sides along the Y-axis (vertical). Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch With the loop created, set the sketch scale to 0.0234. This scaling will make the rectangle's width and height match the specified values in the JSON. Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.75 units to create a thin rectangular prism. Part 2: Construction of the second prism The second prism is a duplicate of the first one, with a different location and orientation. It will be aligned horizontally with the first prism. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system To position the second prism, create a new coordinate system at the following location and orientation: \\\\[\\\\begin{matrix} 0.2674 & 0.0055 & 0.0 \\\\\\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\\\\\\\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 \\\\end{matrix}\\\\] Step 2: Create an identical 2D sketch Using the same sketch as Part 1 (face\\\\_1), produce the second prism's 2D sketch. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Identically, scale the sketch by 0.0234. Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.75 units to create the second prism. Ensure that the positioning is consistent with the coordinate system specified. After completing both parts, you will obtain two parallel and identical thin rectangular prisms. The final 3D model will be created by joining these parts together in the subsequent instructions.</description>",
