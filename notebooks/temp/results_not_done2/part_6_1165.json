The description only details sketches on `face_1` (with its two loops) and `face_2` (with its one loop).\\n\\n- Correction: The description does not fully match the JSON because the sketch information for `face_3` under `part_2` is missing from the description. Therefore, the validity is 'No'.\\n</think>"
