However, the JSON's `arc_2` in `face_2` has `Start Point` [0.2392, 0.0001], `Mid Point` [0.0719, 0.0712], and `End Point` [0.0001, 0.2382]. These points are completely different from the description's definition of this arc. The description's points for `arc_2` in `face_2` seem to correspond to `face_3`'s `arc_1` rather than its own `arc_2` in JSON, and the description does not provide a `Mid Point` for this arc, only a `center` which might lead to a different curve entirely.\\n  - Face 3: `line_1` and `arc_1` match JSON.\\n  - Face 4: `line_1` and `arc_1` match JSON.\\n\\n- Check extrusion details: Extrusion depth, opposite depth, scale, and operation match the JSON.\\n\\n- Correction: There is a critical discrepancy in the `arc_2` definition for `face_2`, `loop_1`. The start, mid, and end points for this arc in the JSON do not match the description's stated points or implied curve. This makes the description inconsistent with the JSON for this specific sketch entity.\\n</think>"
