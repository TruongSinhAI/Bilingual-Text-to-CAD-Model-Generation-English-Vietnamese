However, the JSON shows `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0361` for both parts. This is a mismatch.\\n-- **Sketch Scale**: The description explicitly mentions `sketch_scale: 0.75` for Part 1 but does *not* specify a `sketch_scale` for Part 2 or Part 3. The JSON, however, sets `sketch_scale: 0.0111` for both Part 2 and Part 3. This value (`0.0111`) is the extrusion depth specified in the description, not a scale factor. This is a mismatch.\\n-- **Operation**: The description for Part 2 and Part 3 states \\\"Construct the second part\\\" and \\\"Construct the third part\\\", which typically implies creating a new body (`NewBodyFeatureOperation`) or joining an existing one (`JoinFeatureOperation`). However, the JSON specifies `operation: \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\"` for both Part 2 and Part 3. This is a logical mismatch as the description implies addition, not subtraction.\\n\\n- Correction: The JSON for `part_2` and `part_3` does not fully match the description due to incorrect `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` values, the presence of an unspecified `sketch_scale`, and a contradictory `operation` type. Therefore, the overall JSON does not match the description.\\n</think>"
