This results in four rounded corners for the rectangular prism.\"\n        ,\"\\n  - In CAD, when a face has multiple closed loops (e.g., `loop_1` as a rectangle and `loop_2`-`loop_5` as circles), the typical interpretation is that the first loop (`loop_1`) defines the outer boundary, and subsequent loops (`loop_2`-`loop_5`) define internal cutouts or holes. Therefore, the JSON structure, with separate closed loops for the rectangle and the circles, would result in a rectangular prism with four circular *holes* at its corners, not smoothly *rounded external corners*.\\n  - For rounded external corners (fillets), the primary sketch loop (e.g., `loop_1`) should itself be composed of lines and tangent arcs, forming a single continuous boundary. Alternatively, an explicit filleting operation would be applied to the 3D body after extrusion of a simpler rectangular profile.\\n  - Consequently, while the individual geometrical entities (lines and circles) and their parameters match, the *method* by which \"\n        ,\"rounded corners\"\n        ,\" are achieved as implied by the JSON's sketch structure does not align with the literal meaning of \"\n        ,\"rounded corners\"\n        ,\" in a CAD context. The JSON describes a shape with holes, not rounded solid edges.\\n\\n- Result: The description of \"\n        ,\"rounded corners\"\n        ,\" does not logically correspond to the sketch structure in the JSON, which would create circular holes. Therefore, there is an inconsistency between the described intent and the JSON's geometric representation for this specific feature.\\n</think>"

The JSON structure of two distinct faces matches the descriptive separation.\\n- Result: Part 2 description accurately matches the JSON.\\n\\nFor Part 3:\\n- Coordinate system: The Euler Angles and Translation Vector match the JSON.\\n- Sketch definition: The description for `face_1` `loop_1` is incomplete. It only specifies `line_1` and partially `line_2`. The JSON, however, contains `line_3` through `line_8` for `face_1` `loop_1` and also defines an entire `face_2` with its own `loop_1` and lines, none of which are present in the provided description.\\n- Extrusion: The description completely omits any details regarding the extrusion for Part 3, whereas the JSON provides `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`, and `operation`.\\n- Result: The description for Part 3 is significantly incomplete and therefore does not match the JSON provided for Part 3. Due to this incompleteness, the overall validity for this entire JSON-description pair is 'No'.\\n</think>"
