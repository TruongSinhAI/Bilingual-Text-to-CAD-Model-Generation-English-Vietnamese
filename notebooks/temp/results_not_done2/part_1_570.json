This implies separate extrusion operations for each face, or that these are the *net* extrusion parameters if both faces were part of a single combined sketch. However, the JSON's `extrusion` block for `part_1` defines *single* `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.1268) and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0) values. This structure suggests a single extrusion profile applied to the *entire* sketch defined for `part_1` (which includes both `face_1` and `face_2`), not different extrusions for individual faces within the same part's extrusion.
