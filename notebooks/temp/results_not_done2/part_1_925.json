Set the Euler angles to [−90.0, 0.0, −90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.1513, 0.0, 0.0]. This will create a coordinate system for the 2D sketch plane that is rotated -90 degrees about the X-axis, 0 degrees about the Y-axis, and -90 degrees about the Z-axis, and translated by (0.1513, 0, 0). **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Within the coordinate system defined above, draw a 2D sketch.
