In some cases, creating Part 2 before Part 1 would ensure that the \"Join\" operation is successful in combining both parts. Regardless, the given JSON structure does not explicitly state whether the order of parts matters. Confirm this detail before beginning the construction process to ensure accurate results.</description>",
