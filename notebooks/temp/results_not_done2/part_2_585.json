Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. Here are the details of the sketch: - The sketch is drawn on the X-Y plane and has one face (face\\\\_1). - Face\\\\_1 has one loop (loop\\\\_1). - Loop\\\\_1 has four lines (line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, line\\\\_4). - Line\\\\_1 starts at [0.0, 0.0] and ends at [0.6429, 0.0]. - Line\\\\_2 starts at [0.6429, 0.0] and ends at [0.6429, 0.75]. - Line\\\\_3 starts at [0.6429, 0.75] and ends at [0.0, 0.75]. - Line\\\\_4 starts at [0.0, 0.75] and ends at [0.0, 0.0]. After creating the 2D sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.75. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.75 units. The resulting part will be a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel, the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides, and the dimensions of the sides are equal. The height of the prism is half the length of the sides. The length of the part is 4.8214e-05, the width is 0.75, and the height is 0.75. Note: The operations described above should be performed in the context of a parametric CAD modeling software that supports the use of JSON files to define CAD assemblies. The specific steps and commands required to perform each operation will depend on the software you are using. This instruction set assumes a general understanding of CAD modeling and does not provide specific instructions for any particular software.</description>",
