For the sketch, create a new face with the following loops and curves: * Loop 1: A circle with the center at (0.1491, 0.1491) and a radius of 0.1491. * Loop 2: A circle with the same center at (0.1491, 0.1491) and a radius of 0.0745. Then, set the sketch scale to 0.2981 and extrude the sketch by 0.3726 in the normal direction and 0.0 in the opposite direction. Use the \"New Body Feature Operation\" to complete this part. Part 2: Rectangular Prism with Tapered Top and Bottom Construct a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom, and sides that are parallel and meet at right angles.

Extruding the sketch Now, extrude the sketch in the positive Z direction by 0.25 units with the given scaling: * extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.25 * sketch_scale: 0.75 This operation results in the creation of a new solid body resembling a rectangular prism, with a flat top and bottom and a slightly tapered middle section.</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description focuses on a single part, \\\"Part 1\\\".\\n\\npart_1: (Rectangular Prism with Tapered Middle Section)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from \\\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\\")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.25, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.25, 0.0]\\\")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.25, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"1.
