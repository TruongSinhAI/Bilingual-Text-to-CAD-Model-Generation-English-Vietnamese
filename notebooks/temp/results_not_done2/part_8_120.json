    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A Rectangular Metal Plate with Two Holes on the Top Side** The first part of the CAD model is a rectangular metal plate with two holes on the top side. 1. **Create a new coordinate system**: Set the euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and translation vector to (0.0, 0.0937, 0.0). 2. **Draw the base 2D sketch**: a. **Create face 1**: It will contain three lines and two circles. b. **Draw loop 1 of face 1**: i. Draw line 1: Connect point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.0). ii. Draw line 2: Connect point (0.75, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.25). iii. Draw line 3: Connect point (0.75, 0.25) to point (0.0, 0.25). iv. Draw line 4: Connect point (0.0, 0.25) to point (0.0, 0.0). (Note: This loop creates the outer rectangle.) c. **Draw loop 2 of face 1**: i. Create circle 1: Set the center point to (0.125, 0.125) and radius to 0.0312. (Note: This circle forms one of the holes in the rectangular metal plate.) d. **Draw loop 3 of face 1**: i. Create circle 1: Set the center point to (0.625, 0.125) and radius to 0.0312. (Note: This circle forms the other hole in the rectangular metal plate.) 3. **Transform the 2D sketch to 3D**: Set the sketch scale to 0.75 and perform an extrusion of 0.0937 units along the normal vector. The resulting part should represent the first component of the final assembly – a rectangular metal plate with two holes on the top side, having a length of 0.75 units, width of 0.0938 units, and height of 0.0937 units. **Observations**: 1. The `NewBodyFeatureOperation` value for the `\"operation\"` property indicates that this part corresponds to the first component (base part) of the entire CAD assembly. 2. The first part consists of a single coordinate system, a single sketch (face 1), and a single extrusion. 3. The sketch contains three loops in total, one outer rectangle and two circles formed by `loop_1`, `loop_2`, and `loop_3` respectively. 4. The euler angles represent a rotation around the Z-axis by -90 degrees followed by setting the X and Y axes as the sketch plane. This is a common practice for placing a 2D sketch on a vertical plane. 5. The translation vector along the Z-axis positions the part's vertical orientation higher than the X-Y plane. 6. The `sketch_scale` property can be useful for parts that need to be proportionally resized. It can affect all or part of the sketch, which in turn impacts the extrusion. 7. The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` determine the direction and offset of the extrusion. As both values remain zero except for the `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, this ensures an upward extrusion along the normal vector. 8. The dimensions provided for `length`, `width`, and `height` can assist in external evaluations and validation of the final output. 9. The final CAD model can be imagined as having the first component – a rectangular metal plate with two holes – positioned at a distance of 0.0937 units from the X-Y plane along the Z-axis.</description>",
