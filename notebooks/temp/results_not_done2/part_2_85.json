The top is slightly offset from the base, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The shape is symmetrical and has a smooth, matte finish. Creating the Coordinate System 1. Create a new coordinate system using the following Euler angles and translation vector: - Euler Angles: `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` - Translation Vector: `[0.0, 0.75, 0.0]` Drawing the 2D Sketch for Face 1 2. Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system created in step 1. 3. Draw five lines to form a closed loop: - Line 1: Start Point `[0.0, 0.0]`, End Point `[0.75, 0.0]` - Line 2: Start Point `[0.75, 0.0]`, End Point `[0.75, 0.75]` - Line 3: Start Point `[0.75, 0.75]`, End Point `[0.375, 0.75]` - Line 4: Start Point `[0.375, 0.75]`, End Point `[0.375, 0.375]` - Line 5: Start Point `[0.375, 0.375]`, End Point `[0.0, 0.0]` This loop forms the basis of the rectangular base and triangular top.

Rotate the 2D sketch using the Z-axis rotation angle of -90 degrees (from the Euler Angles) and translate it according to the Translation Vector. Extruding the Sketch 6. Extrude the scaled and transformed 2D sketch along the Z-axis to create the final 3D model. The extrude depth should be 0.75 unit (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`). Additional Information The final dimensions of the part are: - Length: ~0.75 units - Width: ~0.75 units - Height: ~0.75 units The JSON representation of this intermediate CAD part contains all the information needed to create it.
