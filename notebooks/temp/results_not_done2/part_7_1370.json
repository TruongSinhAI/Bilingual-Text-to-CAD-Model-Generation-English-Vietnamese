    "reasoning": "<description>\\n<part\\\\_1> - Construct a Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom The first part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.5, 0.0] 2. Next, create the 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. This sketch will be used to define the shape of the prism. 3. Define a face (face\\\\_1) and add a loop (loop\\\\_1) to the face. 4. Add six line segments to loop\\\\_1, creating a closed shape: - Line\\\\_1: [0.0, 0.0], [0.75, 0.0] - Line\\\\_2: [0.75, 0.0], [0.75, 0.25] - Line\\\\_3: [0.75, 0.25], [0.25, 0.25] - Line\\\\_4: [0.25, 0.25], [0.25, 0.625] - Line\\\\_5: [0.25, 0.625], [0.0, 0.625] - Line\\\\_6: [0.0, 0.625], [0.0, 0.0] 5. Now, create the 3D sketch by scaling and transforming the 2D sketch. - Sketch\\\\_scale: 0.75 - Euler angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] to transform the sketch to the original orientation (XY plane) - Translation vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 6.
