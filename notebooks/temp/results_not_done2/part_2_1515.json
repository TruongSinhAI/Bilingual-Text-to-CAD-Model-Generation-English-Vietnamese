The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value is 0.2772, while the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` value is 0.0. The resulting 3D model should have the following dimensions as per the description: - Length: 0.2772 - Width: 0.2772 - Height: 0.2772 Note the slight variation in the dimensions due to the scaling and extrusion process.</description>",
