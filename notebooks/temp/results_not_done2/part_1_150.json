In typical CAD JSONs, if two faces belong to the same \"\n      , \"sketch\"\n      , \" object and are intended for a single extrusion, they are usually co-planar. The JSON structure shows \"\n      , \"face_1\"\n      , \" and \"\n      , \"face_2\"\n      , \" under a single \"\n      , \"sketch\"\n      , \" object, which is then subject to one \"\n      , \"extrusion\"\n      , \". This strongly implies they are on the same 2D plane (usually the XY plane of the defined coordinate system) for the extrusion. Describing \"\n      , \"face_2\"\n      , \" as being on the \"\n      , \"X-Z plane\"\n      , \" while \"\n      , \"face_1\"\n      , \" is on the \"\n      , \"X-Y plane\"\n      , \" within the same sketch entity for a single extrusion implies a fundamental inconsistency between the description and the common interpretation of the JSON structure. If they were on different planes, they would typically be separate sketch features with their own plane definitions, or the JSON structure would be different to reflect a more complex 3D operation (e.g., loft, sweep). Given the direct extrusion of a single \"\n      , \"sketch\"\n      , \" object containing both faces, they should be co-planar. Therefore, the description is inconsistent with the likely intent of the JSON structure regarding the sketching planes.\\n-Correction: The description's statement about \"\n      , \"face_2\"\n      , \" being on the X-Z plane contradicts the JSON's structure which implies both faces are on the same 2D sketch plane for a single extrusion. Thus, the description does not perfectly match the JSON.\\n</think>"
