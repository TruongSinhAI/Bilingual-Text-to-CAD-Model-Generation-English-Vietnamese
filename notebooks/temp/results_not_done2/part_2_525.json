Extrusion Extrude the sketch along its normal by 0.2326 units. Keep the original sketch and create a new solid body for the extruded shape. This step will not affect previous CAD models. 4. Dimensions and Constraints The length of the part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.2326 units. The loop on each face must be closed and cannot contain any arcs or circles. This concludes the instructions for Part 1. Check that the resulting CAD model matches the given \"CAD Assembly JSON\" and any additional specifications outlined in the project requirements. Ensure that all sketches and faces meet the specified constraints and that the extrusion is of the correct depth. If needed, perform any necessary adjustments to meet those requirements. Once satisfied, you can proceed with constructing other parts or generating any necessary assembly instructions. Confidence: 95%</description>",
