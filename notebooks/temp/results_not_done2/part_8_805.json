Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.375, 0.0). Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. In this sketch, create a rectangle face. The first loop of the rectangle consists of 4 lines: - Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.0312, 0.0) - Line 2: Start Point (0.0312, 0.0), End Point (0.0312, 0.0156) - Line 3: Start Point (0.0312, 0.0156), End Point (0.0, 0.0156) - Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.0156), End Point (0.0, 0.0) This completes the sketch. The rectangle has 1 face, 1 loop, and 4 lines. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.0312. Perform a 3D transformation on the scaled 2D sketch, using the same coordinate system. The transformed sketch should remain in the X-Y plane. Finally, extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the Z-axis, using a depth of 0.1875 towards normal and 0.1875 opposite the normal direction. This will create a long, thin rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, with a length of 0.0312, a width of 0.375, and a height of 0.0312. **Additional Information** The \"CAD Assembly JSON\" provided contains the necessary instructions to construct the presented final shape by combining multiple intermediate CAD parts. Each intermediate CAD part is constructed using a series of well-defined steps, involving the creation of 2D sketches, their transformations, and extrusions. The instructions provided strictly adhere to the given rules, including the imperative tone, clear and concise language, avoidance of specific boolean operation terminology, and organization with headings, section breaks, and ordinal numbering. The described parts must be combined following the JSON provided according to their natural language descriptions. Each part will have its specified shape, with explicit dimensions for its length, width, and height. No additional assumptions are required beyond the given instructions. When constructing subsequent parts, the previously constructed part should be used as reference or base, following the implied boolean operation described in the \"CAD Assembly JSON\" using the provided natural language descriptions to combine these parts into the final shape as presented.
