Draw line 1 from (0.0, 0.3248) to (0.1875, 0.0). Draw line 2 from (0.1875, 0.0) to (0.5625, 0.0). Draw line 3 from (0.5625, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.3248).

The lines form a rectangle with rounded corners. The radius of the circular arcs are determined by the distance between the two corners on each side of the rectangle. **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.232 units. The resulting CAD part is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat top and bottom. The cylindrical hole is centered and has a smaller diameter than the prism's width. The prism is symmetrical along its central axis. The length and width of the prism are 0.75 units, and the height is 0.232 units. The diameter of the cylindrical hole is approximately 0.4 units.</description>",
