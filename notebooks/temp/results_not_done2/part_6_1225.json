The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system: 1. Define the *Euler Angles* as `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]`. 2. Set the *Translation Vector* as `[0.0, 0.1873, 0.0]`. For the 2D sketch, draw the shape on the plane defined by the coordinate system. 1. Create the first face and name it *face_1*. 2. On *face_1*, create the first loop and name it *loop_1*. For *loop_1*, create four lines with these start and end points as shown below: 1. *line_1*: Start Point `[0.0, 0.0]`, End Point `[0.6729, 0.0]` 2. *line_2*: Start Point `[0.6729, 0.0]`, End Point `[0.6729, 0.75]` 3. *line_3*: Start Point `[0.6729, 0.75]`, End Point `[0.0, 0.75]` 4. *line_4*: Start Point `[0.0, 0.75]`, End Point `[0.0, 0.0]` After creating the 2D sketch, transform it into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector of the coordinate system defined earlier and scale the 2D sketch: 1. Set the *sketch_scale* as `0.75`. To generate the 3D model, extrude the 2D sketch: 1. Set *extrude_depth_towards_normal* as `0.1873` and *extrude_depth_opposite_normal* as `0.0`. This step concludes the first intermediate CAD part. The overall shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with the following dimensions: - The length is `0.75`. - The height is `0.75`. - The width is `0.1873`.</description>",
