Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and the translation vector to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Next, create the 2D sketch on the XY plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of one face, face_1, which contains a single loop. The loop consists of four lines: 1. line_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.6563, 0.0) 2. line_2: Start Point (0.6563, 0.0), End Point (0.6563, 0.5625) 3. line_3: Start Point (0.6563, 0.5625), End Point (0.0, 0.5625) 4. line_4: Start Point (0.0, 0.5625), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.6563. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using a rotation of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 degrees and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.375 toward the normal of the sketch plane. **Part 2: Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The length of the prism is twice the width, and the height is half the width. The prism is centered on a white background.** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and the translation vector to 0.0, 0.0, 0.15. Next, create the 2D sketch on the XY plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of one face, face_1, which contains a single loop. The loop consists of four lines: 1. line_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.1875, 0.0) 2. line_2: Start Point (0.1875, 0.0), End Point (0.1875, 0.075) 3. line_3: Start Point (0.1875, 0.075), End Point (0.0, 0.075) 4. line_4: Start Point (0.0, 0.075), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.1875. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using a rotation of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 degrees and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.75 toward the opposite direction of the normal of the sketch plane.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description identifies two parts: \\\"Part 1: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom\\\" and \\\"Part 2: Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom\\\".
