    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: Rectangular Prism** The first part of the CAD assembly is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and parallel sides. The top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides, and the dimensions of the prism are 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameter values: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (-0.064, 0.337, 0.0) Next, create the 2D sketch for this part. For this part, the sketch will be drawn on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1), with a single loop (loop\\\\_1) that contains four lines (line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, line\\\\_4). The lines form a rectangle, with the following endpoints: * line\\\\_1: (0.0, 0.0) and (0.846, 0.0) * line\\\\_2: (0.846, 0.0) and (0.846, 0.3372) * line\\\\_3: (0.846, 0.3372) and (0.0, 0.3372) * line\\\\_4: (0.0, 0.3372) and (0.0, 0.0) The 2D sketch is now complete, and should be scaled using the scaling parameter (sketch\\\\_scale = 0.846). Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (-0.064, 0.337, 0.0) The final step is to extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. For this part, extrude the sketch by 0.337 units towards the normal, and 0 units in the opposite direction of the normal (extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal = 0.337, extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal = 0.0). The completed intermediate part should have the following dimensions: * length: 0.846 * width: 0.337 * height: 0.846</description>",
