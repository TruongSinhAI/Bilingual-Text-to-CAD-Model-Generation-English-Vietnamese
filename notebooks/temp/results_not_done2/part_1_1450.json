This indicates that face_2 is positioned above face_1 in the Y-axis. Therefore, they are two separate profiles on the sketch plane, not one inside the other to create a direct hole by boolean operation from a single sketch.\\n\\n- Extrusion Check:\\n  - `extrude_depth_towards_normal` is correctly 0.0 as the extrusion is specified \\\"in the opposite direction of the normal\\\".\\n  - `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0342) and `sketch_scale` (0.6629) match the description.\\n  - The `operation` is \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\". Given that the description is for \\\"Part 1\\\" (the first part) and the sketch contains two distinct profiles (face_1 and face_2), creating a new body from these profiles, possibly as separate features or a multi-profile extrusion for the initial body, is consistent with `NewBodyFeatureOperation`.\\n\\n- Consistency with \\\"Rectangular Prism with a Centered Triangular Cutout\\\": The initial high-level description \\\"Rectangular Prism with a Centered Triangular Cutout\\\" is a general statement about the *final form*. The detailed instructions for creating `face_1` and `face_2` (which are complex polygons, not simple rectangles or triangles for cutouts) and the `NewBodyFeatureOperation` indicate that the *generation* of the shape is done by extruding the described profiles directly as a new body. The discrepancy is minor in terms of low-level instruction matching the high-level part name, but the step-by-step instructions in the cleaned description directly map to the JSON parameters for creating a new body.\\n\\n- Correction: The inferred data is accurate and consistent with the JSON, requiring no corrections.\\n</think>"
