    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism Step 1: Create the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. Set the Euler angles as [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector as [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. This configuration will define the orientation and position of the 2D sketch for this part. Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Follow these instructions to create the loops and faces: 1. **Face 1:** * **Loop 1:** 1. **Line 1:** Start Point at [0.0, 0.0]; End Point at [0.3, 0.0] 2. **Line 2:** Start Point at [0.3, 0.0]; End Point at [0.3, 0.3] 3. **Line 3:** Start Point at [0.3, 0.3]; End Point at [0.0, 0.3] 4. **Line 4:** Start Point at [0.0, 0.3]; End Point at [0.0, 0.0] The given sketch has one face and one loop, with 4 lines. Step 3: Transform the Sketch into 3D Sketch Change the sketch to a 3D sketch. Now, apply the transformation with the given rotation (Euler angles) and translation vector from the coordinate system. Step 4: Extrude the Sketch into a 3D Model Extrude the 2D sketch into 3D along the Z-axis. The extrusion values are as follows: * Extrusion Depth Towards Normal: 0.75 * Extrusion Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 * Sketch Scale: 0.3 After applying the given parameters, this operation will create a 3D model of a three-dimensional rectangular prism. The dimensions of this prism's sides are equal, and the height is half the length of the sides. Part 1 is complete. Continue on to the next parts in the CAD assembly JSON, following the same pattern: create a coordinate system, draw the 2D sketch, transform it into a 3D sketch, and then extrude the sketch into a 3D model. This method will ensure you generate the accurate CAD models needed for the assembly.</description>",

Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translation vector `[0.0, 0.375, 0.0]`. Now create the 2D sketch for the base of the part on face 1 of the coordinate system.

The sketch should look like two concentric circles. Next, scale the 2D sketch with the scaling parameter 0.75. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translation vector `[0.0, 0.375, 0.0]`. Now, extrude the 3D sketch with a depth of 0.375 units towards the normal and a depth of 0 opposite the normal, resulting in a length of 0.75 units.

Create the 2D sketch for the base of the part on face 1 of the coordinate system. Draw one circle with the following properties: - Circle 1: Center at `[0.0491, 0.0491]`, radius 0.0491 Since there is only one face, there is only one face in the sketch. The sketch should look like a single circle. Scale the 2D sketch with the scaling parameter 0.0982. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translation vector `[0.3259, 0.375, 0.3259]`. Now, extrude the 3D sketch with a depth of 0.0938 units towards the normal and a depth of 0 opposite the normal, resulting in a length of 0.0983 units. Part 3: Construct a ring with a curved surface and a hollow center. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translation vector `[0.0, 0.375, 0.0]`. Draw a 2D sketch for the base of the part on face 1 of the coordinate system. Create two circles with the following properties: - Circle 1: Center at `[0.375, 0.375]`, radius 0.375 - Circle 2: Center at `[0.375, 0.375]`, radius 0.3516 Since there are no other faces, this results in one face in the sketch. Next, scale the 2D sketch with the scaling parameter 0.75. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translation vector `[0.0, 0.375, 0.0]`. Extrude the 3D sketch with depth 0.1875 towards the normal direction and a depth of 0 opposite the normal direction, resulting in a length of 0.75 units.
