For a cut operation in CAD, if the extrusion is specified as a positive depth and then cut, it typically means `extrude_depth_towards_normal` is 0 and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is the depth of the cut.

However, all coordinates explicitly match the JSON. The term \\\"rectangular hole\\\" in the description is a semantic simplification, but the geometric definition in terms of lines is accurate to the JSON.\\n\\n- Extrusion Parameters:\\n  - `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0205), `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0), and `sketch_scale` (0.0565) values are accurate and match the JSON. The operation \\\"Create a new solid body\\\" correctly corresponds to \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\".\\n\\n- Overall Consistency:\\n  - All numerical values and geometric definitions for the coordinate system, sketch elements (circle and lines), and extrusion parameters are consistent with the JSON. The semantic label for Loop 2 being a \\\"rectangle\\\" is a minor descriptive inaccuracy but does not affect the correctness of the generated geometry based on the provided points. Thus, it's considered a valid match.\\n  - No corrections needed.\\n</think>"
