    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. 1. Create a new coordinate system. For the Euler angles, use 0.0 for X, 0.0 for Y, and -90.0 for Z. For the translation vector, use 0.0 for X, 0.5 for Y, and 0.0 for Z. 2. Begin a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the created coordinate system. 3. Draw a rectangle with the following vertices: - Point 1: [0.0, 0.0] - Point 2: [0.75, 0.0] - Point 3: [0.75, 0.4167] - Point 4: [0.0, 0.4167] 4. Close the loop, making sure it has four vertices as described in step 3. 5. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. 6. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D by applying the rotation angles and translation vector of the coordinate system. 7. Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D shape with a depth of 0.5 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal. This will result in a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Part 2: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The front face is angled at 45 degrees. The dimensions are 0.5 units by 0.1667 units by 0.5 units. 1. Create a new coordinate system, same as Part 1, but with a translation vector of [0.25, 0.5, 0.0] for the X, Y, and Z values, respectively. 2. Begin a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the created coordinate system. 3. Draw a trapezoid with the following vertices: - Point 1: [0.0, 0.4167] - Point 2: [0.1667, 0.0] - Point 3: [0.5, 0.0] - Point 4: [0.3333, 0.4167] 4. Close the loop as described in step 3. 5. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.5. 6. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D by applying the rotation angles and translation vector of the coordinate system. 7. Perform a cut extrusion on the 2D sketch with a depth of 0.1667 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal. This will create the desired prism with a front face angled at 45 degrees. Final shape: Combining the two parts mentioned above, you will obtain a three-dimensional geometric shape with various forms, including rectangles, triangles, and curved surfaces. The length of this shape will be approximately 2 units, the width will be approximately 3 units, and the height will be approximately 4 units. Other dimensions of the composite shape, including faces and loops of individual parts, are provided in the JSON snippet above.</description>",
