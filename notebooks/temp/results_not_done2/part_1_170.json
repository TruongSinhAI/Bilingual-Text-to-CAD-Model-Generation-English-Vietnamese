These lines form closed rectangles. The coordinates for all lines are correctly transcribed.\\n  - Extrusion: Extrusion depths and sketch scale are correct. The operation `JoinFeatureOperation` is a logical inference given that Part 2 is \\\"positioned on a flat surface\\\" which implies it's being added to a pre-existing part (Part 1).\\n\\n--Result: All inferred components and their values are accurate and consistent with the description, with logical inferences for the `operation` types.
