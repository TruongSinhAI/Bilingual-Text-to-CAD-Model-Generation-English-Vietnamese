Next, create the 2D sketch for the bottom face of the prism. The bottom face is a rectangle with the following dimensions: - Width: 0.2335 meters - Length: 0.75 meters The rectangle can be constructed by creating four lines, as follows: - Line 1: Start point [0.0, 0.0], end point [0.1287, 0.0] - Line 2: Start point [0.1287, 0.0], end point [0.1287, 0.1287] - Line 3: Start point [0.1287, 0.1287], end point [0.2022, 0.1287] - Line 4: Start point [0.2022, 0.1287], end point [0.2022, 0.192] - Line 5: Start point [0.2022, 0.192], end point [0.0227, 0.192] - Line 6: Start point [0.0227, 0.192], end point [0.0, 0.1415] - Line 7: Start point [0.0, 0.1415], end point [0.0, 0.0] After creating the rectangle, add the sketch scale factor of 0.75. Then, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.2335 meters, resulting in the bottom rectangular prism. **Part 2: Top Rectangular Prism** The second part of the assembly is another rectangular prism, which is placed on top of the first prism. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.467, 0.0]. Next, create a 2D sketch for the top face of the prism. The top face is a rectangle with the same dimensions as the bottom face: - Width: 0.2335 meters - Length: 0.75 meters The rectangle can be constructed by creating four lines, as follows: - Line 1: Start point [0.0435, 0.5478], end point [0.6871, 0.5478] - Line 2: Start point [0.6871, 0.5478], end point [0.6871, 0.6489] - Line 3: Start point [0.6871, 0.6489], end point [0.0435, 0.6489] - Line 4: Start point [0.0435, 0.6489], end point [0.0435, 0.5478] After creating the rectangle, add the sketch scale factor of 0.75. Then, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.2335 meters, resulting in the top rectangular prism. The final assembly is a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a smaller rectangular prism on top of it, with a combined height of 0.75 + 0.2335 = 0.9835 meters.</description>",
