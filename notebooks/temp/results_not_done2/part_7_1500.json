Create a new coordinate system based on the provided `Euler Angles` and `Translation Vector`. This will serve as the reference frame for the construction of the object. 2. Within this coordinate system, draw the initial 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. Begin by creating a circle on `face_1` using the given parameters in `circle_1`. *Scale and transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch* 3. Apply the given `sketch_scale` to the circle. 4. Transform the scaled circle into a 3D sketch by rotating it along the X-axis by the first euler angle, then along the Y-axis by the second euler angle, and lastly along the Z-axis by the third euler angle. Apply the given `Translation Vector` as a final transformation step. *Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the CAD model* 5. Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal vector based on the provided `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, and along the opposite direction of the normal vector based on the provided `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`.
