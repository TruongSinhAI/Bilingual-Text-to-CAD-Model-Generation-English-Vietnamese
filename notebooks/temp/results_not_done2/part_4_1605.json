    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation and a translation vector of [0, 0, 0]. For the sketch, create a rectangle on the XY plane. This rectangle will have four lines: 1. Line 1: Start Point [0, 0], End Point [0.5162, 0] 2. Line 2: Start Point [0.5162, 0], End Point [0.5162, 0.2743] 3. Line 3: Start Point [0.5162, 0.2743], End Point [0, 0.2743] 4. Line 4: Start Point [0, 0.2743], End Point [0, 0] The rectangle has a width of 0.5162 units and a height of 0.2743 units. Extrude the sketch along the positive Z-axis (towards the normal) by 0.0527 units and along the negative Z-axis (opposite of normal) by 0 units. This creates a prism-like shape, with the initial sketch serving as the top face and a duplicate sketch serving as the bottom face. Apply a scaling factor of 0.5162 to the sketch before extruding it. Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Tapered Top and Flat Bottom Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered top and flat bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of [0.264, 0.0164, 0.0527]. For the first sketch, create a circle centered at [0.0409, 0.0409] with a radius of 0.0409. This circle is located on the XY plane. For the second sketch, create another circle at the same location ([0.0409, 0.0409]) with the same radius as the first circle, also on the XY plane. Extrude both circles simultaneously along the positive Z-axis (towards the normal) by 0 units and along the negative Z-axis (opposite to normal) by 0.0527 units. This creates a cylinder-like shape with two concentric circles forming the top and bottom, and a flat central plane between them. Apply a scaling factor of 0.0818 to the sketches before extruding. Part 3: Cylindrical Object with Ridges Construct a cylindrical object with ridges. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of [0.2755, 0.0266, 0.0527]. For the sketch, create a circle centered at [0.029, 0.029] with a radius of 0.029. This circle is located on the XY plane. Extrude the circle along the positive Z-axis (towards the normal) by 0 units and along the negative Z-axis (opposite of normal) by 0.0532 units. This creates a cylinder-like shape with the initial circle forming the top and bottom surfaces, and an extrusion depth of 0.0532 units serving as the height of the cylinder. Apply a scaling factor of 0.058 to the sketch before extruding. Note that the \"cut\" operation for this part implies that the cylinder-like shape should have its volume reduced, leaving behind only the ridges similar to those of a gear or spur. However, the specific method for achieving this outcome will depend on the chosen CAD software. Refer to the software documentation for creating this effect, like subtracting the volume of a gear from the cylinder-like shape's volume. The final height of the entire assembly, accounting for the sum of all parts and their offsets, is approximately twice the width. The width and length of the base part determine the width and length of the entire assembly. The combined height of all the parts based on the provided data is approximately 0.2119 units (with a prism height of 0.0527, cylindrical hole top and bottom pieces with a height of 0.0527 + 0.0532, and a height of 0.0527 for the third part).</description>",
