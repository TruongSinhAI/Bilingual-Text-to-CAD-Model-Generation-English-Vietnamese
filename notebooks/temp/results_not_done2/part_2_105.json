Conclusion The CAD design consists of two parts, each with four faces. Part 1 has a circular base and a complex top, with holes and a triangular shape. Part 2 has a top and bottom face that are identical to Part 1's Face 2 and Face 1, respectively. Both parts have a height of approximately 0.1538 and 0.3077 units, respectively, with a sketch scale factor of 0.75 and 0.3462, respectively. The final shape of the CAD model will be created by combining the two parts using the specified extrusion operations and boolean operations.</description>",
