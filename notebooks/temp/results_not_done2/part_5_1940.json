Refer to the given rules for writing the instructions. Remember to: 1. Clearly state the shape being constructed. 2. Use detailed step-by-step instructions for each part. 3. Use clear headings and section breaks. 4. Provide dimensions and curves, loops, and faces information. 5. Avoid specific boolean operation terms. 6. Use ordinal numbers to denote parts, sketches, curves, loops, and faces. By following these guidelines, the junior CAD designer will be able to generate the required parametric CAD models accurately.</description>",

For the sketch, draw a rectangle on face 1 using the following lines: - line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.15, 0.0] - line 2: Start Point [0.15, 0.0], End Point [0.15, 0.75] - line 3: Start Point [0.15, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] - line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Extrude the sketch by 0 units along the normal and 0.15 units in the opposite direction. Use a sketch scale of 0.75. This operation cuts material from the previous body. ****Part 3: Cylindrical Cutout**** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.225, 0.275, 0.3]. For the sketch, draw a circle on face 1 using the following parameters: - circle: Center [0.1, 0.1], Radius 0.1 Extrude the sketch by 0 units along the normal and 1.25 units in the opposite direction. Use a sketch scale of 0.2. This operation cuts material from the previous body. The final shape should be a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a slightly tapered top and bottom, while the cylindrical hole has a slightly tapered top and bottom with a smooth surface.</description>",
