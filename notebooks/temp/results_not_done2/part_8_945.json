The prism is centered on a white background. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector to (0, 0, 0). This will serve as the base coordinate system for this part. Next, create a new sketch using the base coordinate system. The sketch will be drawn on a flat plane, so set the orientation according to the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1) with a single loop (loop\\\\_1). The loop has four lines: 1. Line\\\\_1: Start point is (0, 0), end point is (0.75, 0). 2. Line\\\\_2: Start point is (0.75, 0), end point is (0.75, 0.2). 3.

Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75 to match the desired length and width of the final part. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector. In this case, the euler angles are already set to (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector is (0, 0, 0). Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use a normal depth of 0.4265, and direction opposite the normal as 0.0. This will create a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. Part 2 Create a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The height is twice the width, and the length is three times the width. The sides are parallel to each other. Start by generating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0, 0, -90) and the translation vector to (0.2526, 0, 0.3265). Create a new sketch based on this coordinate system. Align the sketch with the coordinate system. Similar to Part 1, this sketch has a single face (face\\\\_1) with a single loop (loop\\\\_1) containing four connecting lines: 1. Line\\\\_1: Start point is (0, 0), end point is (0.325, 0). 2.

To create the desired dimensional relationships between the length, height, and width, adjust the sketch scale by using a scaling parameter of 0.325. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector. In this case, the euler angles are (0, 0, -90) and the translation vector is (0.2526, 0, 0.3265). Extrude the 2D sketch along the opposite direction of the normal. Use a normal depth of 0.0 and a opposite direction depth of 0.05 to form a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.

Line\\\\\\\\_3: Start point is (0.75, 0.2), end point is (0, 0.2). 4. Line\\\\\\\\_4: Start point is (0, 0.2), end point is (0, 0). Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75 to match the desired length and width of the final part. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector. In this case, the euler angles are already set to (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector is (0, 0, 0). Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use a normal depth of 0.4265, and direction opposite the normal as 0.0. Part 2 Create a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The height is twice the width, and the length is three times the width. The sides are parallel to each other. Start by generating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0, 0, -90) and the translation vector to (0.2526, 0, 0.3265). Create a new sketch based on this coordinate system. Align the sketch with the coordinate system. Similar to Part 1, this sketch has a single face (face\\\\\\\\_1) with a single loop (loop\\\\\\\\_1) containing four connecting lines: 1. Line\\\\\\\\_1: Start point is (0, 0), end point is (0.325, 0). 2. Line\\\\\\\\_2: Start point is (0.325, 0), end point is (0.325, 0.1). 3. Line\\\\\\\\_3: Start point is (0.325, 0.1), end point is (0, 0.1). 4. Line\\\\\\\\_4: Start point is (0, 0.1), end point is (0, 0). To create the desired dimensional relationships between the length, height, and width, adjust the sketch scale by using a scaling parameter of 0.325. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector. In this case, the euler angles are (0, 0, -90) and the translation vector is (0.2526, 0, 0.3265). Extrude the 2D sketch along the opposite direction of the normal. Use a normal depth of 0.0 and a opposite direction depth of 0.05.
