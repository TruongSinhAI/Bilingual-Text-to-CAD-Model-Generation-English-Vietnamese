    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with euler angles set to (0, 0, 0) and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0). Create a new sketch on the XY plane. Draw a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.375. The skirt of the cylinder will be constructed based on this circle. The extrusion depth will be 0.1594 units towards the normal and no extrusion will occur in the opposite direction. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. This will taper the cylindrical section. Part 2 Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal and the height is half the length of the sides. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of (0, 0, 0) and a translation vector of (0.2525, 0.1992, 0.1594). This offset from the previous part will ensure proper alignment and positioning in the final assembly. Create a new sketch on the XY plane. Draw a rectangle by creating four lines with the following coordinates: 1. Line 1: Start Point (0, 0), End Point (0.2451, 0) 2. Line 2: Start Point (0.2451, 0), End Point (0.2451, 0.3517) 3. Line 3: Start Point (0.2451, 0.3517), End Point (0, 0.3517) 4. Line 4: Start Point (0, 0.3517), End Point (0, 0) In the extrusion phase, move along the normal vector by 0.1594 units and do not extrude in the opposite direction. Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.3517, setting the width and length of the prism to 0.3517 units and the height to 0.1594 units. Now, you have constructed the parametric CAD model by following the instructions given in the CAD Assembly JSON. The final shape is a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, connected by a cylindrical section. The top and bottom sections are parallel to each other, and the cylindrical section is slightly larger than the top and bottom sections. The intermediate parts include a tapered cylindrical section and a three-dimensional rectangular prism.</description>",
