    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Creating a three-dimensional CAD model of a rectangular prism with a pointed end Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.2091, 0.0) Sketch Face 1 Create the first face and sketch the following shape: 1.

Draw a line from point (0.6287, 0.5801) to point (0.3513, 0.5801). 5. Draw a line from point (0.3513, 0.5801) to point (0.0, 0.5801). 6. Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.5801) to point (0.0, 0.0).
