We will begin by creating a new coordinate system, and then create two faces with loops and curves for each face. After that, we will extrude the faces to form our final shape. Let's begin. Create Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system using the provided Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector (0.0084, 0.0021, 0.375). Sketch Faces Now, let's create two faces with loops and curves within each loop. Face 1 * Create a loop with four alternating curves: 1. Arc 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.069), Mid Point (0.0229, 0.0), End Point (0.0816, 0.0429). 2. Line 1: Start Point (0.0816, 0.0429), End Point (0.053, 0.052). 3. Arc 2: Start Point (0.053, 0.052), Mid Point (0.0309, 0.025), End Point (0.0286, 0.0598). 4. Line 2: Start Point (0.0286, 0.0598), End Point (0.0, 0.069). Face 2 * Create a loop with four alternating curves: 1. Arc 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.069), Mid Point (0.0504, 0.0857), End Point (0.0816, 0.0429). 2. Line 1: Start Point (0.0816, 0.0429), End Point (0.053, 0.052). 3. Arc 2: Start Point (0.053, 0.052), Mid Point (0.0424, 0.0607), End Point (0.0286, 0.0598). 4. Line 2: Start Point (0.0286, 0.0598), End Point (0.0, 0.069). Extrude Faces Extrude both faces in both the normal and opposite directions by 0.1875 units. Apply a scaling factor of 0.0857.</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description refers to a single \\\"Part 1\\\".
