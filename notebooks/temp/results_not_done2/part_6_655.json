This means all loops within `face_1` are extruded together to form the new body. For `loop_2` to be a hole, it should be an inner loop of `loop_1` in the same `face_1` (which is correctly represented in the JSON if `loop_2` creates a void within `loop_1` when extruded). However, the description's implication of a separate cut operation contradicts the JSON's single 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'.\\n\\n- Conclusion: The description is inconsistent with the JSON. It misses a significant part of the sketch (`loop_3`) and misrepresents the structure of the sketch faces and extrusion operations for the hole.\\n</think>"
