Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0046, 0.0] Sketch Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. * Face 1 + Loop 1 - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.6182], End Point [0.0645, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.0645, 0.0], End Point [0.1197, 0.0] - Arc 1: Start Point [0.1197, 0.0], Mid Point [0.2762, 0.0134], End Point [0.4328, 0.0] - Line 3: Start Point [0.4328, 0.0], End Point [0.488, 0.0] - Line 4: Start Point [0.488, 0.0], End Point [0.5524, 0.6182] - Arc 2: Start Point [0.5524, 0.6182], Mid Point [0.5143, 0.6269], End Point [0.4759, 0.6343] - Arc 3: Start Point [0.4759, 0.6343], Mid Point [0.2762, 0.75], End Point [0.0765, 0.6343] - Arc 4: Start Point [0.0765, 0.6343], Mid Point [0.0381, 0.6269], End Point [0.0, 0.6182] All loops are closed and consist of multiple lines and arcs. No loops consist of a line and a circle or an arc and a circle.
