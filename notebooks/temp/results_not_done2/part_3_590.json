Additionally, loop_2 consists of a single circle. **Step 3: Scale and transform the sketch** Scale the sketch using a factor of 0.75, apply the given euler angles, and translate the sketches to the stated position. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the positive Z-axis by a distance of 0.2314. This will create the first part with the rectangular prism and a cylindrical hole in the center. - Final shape dimensions: 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.2314 Continue with the remaining parts as needed, using the JSON information provided. Remember to apply the correct euler angles and translation vectors for each part, and use the given sketch details to create loops and faces as described.

Additionally, add a 0.0691 unit extrusion in the opposite direction of the normal. This completes the first part of the assembly, which is a rectangular prism with tapered sides. Part 2: Construct a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 2. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0, and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.1984, 0.0].

Start with a new sketch on face 1. 2. Draw a line (line\\\\_1) with a start point of [0.0, 0.0] and an end point of [0.6793, 0.0]. This will be the bottom horizontal edge of the prism. 3. Draw a line (line\\\\_2) with a start point of [0.6793, 0.0] and an end point of [0.6793, 0.3731]. This will be the vertical edge on the right side of the prism. 4. Draw a line (line\\\\_3) with a start point of [0.6793, 0.3731] and an end point of [0.0, 0.3731]. This will be the top horizontal edge of the prism. 5. Complete the loop definition by drawing a line (line\\\\_4) with a start point of [0.0, 0.3731] and an end point of [0.0, 0.0].
