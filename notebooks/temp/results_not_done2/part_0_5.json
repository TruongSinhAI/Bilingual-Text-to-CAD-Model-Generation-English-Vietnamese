The euler angles for this coordinate system are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees, and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.2924, 0.0]. This new coordinate system will define the orientation and position of the 2D sketch that will be used to create the first part. The 2D sketch for this part consists of two faces, face_1 and face_2. Face_1 contains two loops, loop_1 and loop_2, and face_2 is a closed loop. **Face 1** Loop_1 in face_1 consists of the following lines: 1. line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] 2. line_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.3005] 3. line_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.3005], End Point [0.0, 0.3005] 4. line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.3005], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Loop_2 in face_1 consists of the following lines and is closed: 1. line_1: Start Point [0.0013, 0.0013], End Point [0.7487, 0.0013] 2. line_2: Start Point [0.7487, 0.0013], End Point [0.7487, 0.2992] 3. line_3: Start Point [0.7487, 0.2992], End Point [0.0013, 0.2992] 4. line_4: Start Point [0.0013, 0.2992], End Point [0.0013, 0.0013] **Face 2** Face_2 is a closed loop: 1. line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0, 0.3005] 2. line_2: Start Point [0.0, 0.3005], End Point [0.75, 0.3005] 3. line_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.3005], End Point [0.75, 0.0] 4. line_4: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Once the 2D sketch is complete, it needs to be scaled using the `sketch_scale` parameter. The scaling factor to use is 0.75. Next, the scaled 2D sketch should be transformed into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate_system defined earlier. The transformation step rotates the 2D sketch about the origin and translates it to its desired location in 3D space. Finally, the 3D part is created using an extrusion operation. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.2924, and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0.0. The `operation` for the extrusion is `NewBodyFeatureOperation`. The description of this part includes the following properties: 1. Shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. 2. Length: 0.75 units 3. Width: 0.2924 units 4. Height: 0.75 units These instructions provide the necessary steps for generating a parametric CAD model of the first intermediate part as described in the given JSON.
