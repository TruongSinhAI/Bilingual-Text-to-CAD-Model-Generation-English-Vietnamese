The top surface is angled at 45 degrees. - Length: 0.025 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.75 units This is the first of the intermediate parts. It forms the foundation for the final CAD model, which consists of a rectangular metal plate with rounded corners and a flat bottom. The top surface of the plate is angled at 45 degrees. The face 1 of the sketch contains five loops, each with its own geometric features. The loops 1, 2, 4, and 5 form the rectangular shape of the metal plate. The rounded corners are created by loops 2 and 3, and loops 4 and 5. When scaled and converted to a 3D model, these loops create the desired 3D shape. The boolean operation on this part results in the creation of a new solid body. Subsequent parts will be constructed based on this foundation. **Final CAD Model** Now, to construct the final shape, the intermediate part 1 will be integrated with other parts using appropriate boolean operations, as described below: **Step 1**: Create a new coordinate system. **Step 2**: Prepare the second part by following the process for `<part_2>`. **Step 3**: Perform a boolean operation between the final shape and the `<part_2>` using the description: \"Join the second part to the final shape.\" **Step 4**: Prepare the third part by following the process for `<part_3>`. **Step 5**: Perform a boolean operation between the final shape (after joining `<part_2>`) and `<part</description>",
