The circle description, however, matches correctly.\\n\\n- Sketch structure:\\n-- The description uses \"\n    ,\"*Sketch 1:*\"\n    ,\" and \"\n    ,\"*Sketch 2:*\"\n    ,\" to delineate the content for \"\n    ,\"face_1\"\n    ,\" and \"\n    ,\"face_2\"\n    ,\" respectively, which is a minor stylistic difference but logically maps.

For instance, \"\n    ,\"Arc 1: Start Point (0.1602, 0.71), Mid Point (0.0, 0.2058), End Point (0.4874, 0.0)\"\n    ,\" would be the correct description for arc_1 in loop_1, face_1.\\n</think>"
