While the geometry in the JSON for the second part is a simple rectangular extrusion for a cut, the detailed steps precisely match the JSON parameters. This consistency of detailed steps is the primary criterion for matching.\\\\n\\\\n-Correction: All components, their parameters, and operations described in the detailed steps for both Part 1 and Part 2 are accurately and completely reflected in the JSON.
