However, the coordinates provided in both the description and JSON for 'face_2' ([0.125, 0.25], [0.5, 0.5], [0.25, 0.5]) are 2D coordinates typically representing X and Y. If it were on the YZ plane, the coordinates would typically be expected to represent Y and Z values, and the JSON structure usually would include a plane definition or a different coordinate format if it were truly on a non-XY plane. The current JSON structure and coordinate format imply it's an XY sketch, contradicting the description.\\n\\n- Part 1 Extrusion:\\n  - 'extrude_depth_towards_normal' and 'extrude_depth_opposite_normal' (0.1875) match.\\n  - 'sketch_scale' (0.5) matches.\\n  - 'operation' ('NewBodyFeatureOperation') matches.\\n\\n- Part 2 Sketch (face_1):\\n  - The lines (line_1 to line_3) form a closed triangular loop. All start and end points connect correctly.\\n\\n- Part 2 Extrusion:\\n  - 'extrude_depth_towards_normal' and 'extrude_depth_opposite_normal' (0.0625) match.\\n  - 'sketch_scale' (0.375) matches.\\n  - 'operation' ('CutFeatureOperation') matches 'Remove the specified material'.\\n\\n- Correction: The significant discrepancy for 'face_2' in Part 1 (description specifies YZ plane, but JSON coordinates are XY-like and no explicit plane is stated for face_2) indicates an inconsistency. Therefore, the JSON does not perfectly match the description's intent for the plane of 'face_2'.\\n</think>"
