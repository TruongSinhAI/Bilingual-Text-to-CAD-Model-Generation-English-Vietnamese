The prism has a flat top and bottom. The front face is angled at approximately 45 degrees from the top and bottom faces. The side faces are perpendicular to the front face. Sketch face 1 First, create a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch should include the following: * Loop 1 (counter-clockwise): + Line 1 (red): Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.7409, 0.0] + Line 2 (green): Start Point = [0.7409, 0.0], End Point = [0.4874, 0.4313] + Arc 1 (blue): Start Point = [0.4874, 0.4313], Mid Point = [0.3721, 0.5408], End Point = [0.2567, 0.4313] + Line 3 (red): Start Point = [0.2567, 0.4313], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] * Loop 2: + Circle 1 (centered on the hole): Center = [0.3688, 0.4313], Radius = 0.0574 Loop 1 is a closed loop with 4 straight lines and 1 arc. Loop 2 is a circle and will serve as the cylindrical hole.
