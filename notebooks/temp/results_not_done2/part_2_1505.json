    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin `(0, 0, 0)`, with a translation vector of `(0, 0, 0)` and euler angles of `(0, 0, 0)`. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane. Scale the sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75. The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1) containing one loop (loop\\\\_1) made up of a single circle (circle\\\\_1). The circle has its center at `(0.375, 0.375)` and a radius of 0.375. Extrude the sketch along the Z axis, resulting in a depth of 0.0682 towards the normal and 0 depth in the opposite direction, for a total height of 0.0682. This completes the first intermediate part. Part 2 Create a coordinate system at `(0.2045, 0.2045, 0.0682)` with a translation vector of `(0.2045, 0.2045, 0.0682)` and euler angles of `(0, 0, 0)`. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane, scaling the sketch by a factor of 0.3409. The sketch consists of one face (face\\\\_1) containing one loop (loop\\\\_1) composed of a single circle (circle\\\\_1). The circle has its center at `(0.1705, 0.1705)` and a radius of 0.1705. Extrude the sketch along the Z axis, with a depth of 0.017 towards the normal and 0 depth in the opposite direction, for a total height of 0.017. This forms the second intermediate part. Part 3 Set the coordinate system at `(0.2438, 0.2438, 0.0852)` with a translation vector of `(0.2438, 0.2438, 0.0852)` and euler angles of `(0, 0, 0)`. Create a 2D sketch on the XY plane, scaling the sketch by a factor of 0.2625. The sketch comprises one face (face\\\\_1) with one loop (loop\\\\_1) constructed from a single circle (circle\\\\_1). The circle is centered at `(0.1312, 0.1312)` with a radius of 0.1312. Extrude the sketch along the Z axis, extending 0.2216 towards the normal with no depth in the opposite direction, resulting in a height of 0.2216. This is the third intermediate part. Part 4 Build a coordinate system at `(0.2727, 0.2727, 0.3068)` using a translation vector of `(0.2727, 0.2727, 0.3068)` and euler angles of `(0, 0, 0)`. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane, scaling the sketch by a factor of 0.2045. The sketch features one face (face\\\\_1) with one loop (loop\\\\_1) made of a single circle (circle\\\\_1). Circle parameters include a center at `(0.1023, 0.1023)` and a radius of 0.1023. Extrude the sketch along the Z axis, with 0 extending towards the normal and 0.2216 in the opposite direction, for a total height of 0.2216.

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Instructions Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Use the provided translation vector to position the origin, and the euler angles to orient it as follows: - Translation Vector: (0.002, 0.375, 0.0674) - Euler Angles: (0, 0, -90) Create the first face of the sketch on this plane. On this face, we will draw four curves: two arcs and two lines. Start by drawing the first arc (arc_1), defined by these points: - Start Point: (0.1967, 0.1116) - Mid Point: (0.0, 0.0226) - End Point: (0.2157, 0.0132) Next, draw line_1 from the end point of arc_1 to the next point: - Start Point: (0.2157, 0.0132) - End Point: (0.2619, 0.0) Draw the second arc (arc_2), defined by the following points: - Start Point: (0.2619, 0.0) - Mid Point: (0.2651, 0.0738) - End Point: (0.2347, 0.141) Lastly, draw line_2 from the end point of arc_2 to the beginning point of arc_1, creating a closed loop: - Start Point: (0.2347, 0.141) - End Point: (0.1967, 0.1116) Now, since there is only one loop in the sketch, the loop is automatically closed. As for the curve requirement, we have a loop consisting of two arcs and two lines. Make sure to apply the required constraints to ensure a correctly formed shape. Scale the 2D Sketch Use the scaling parameter `sketch_scale` with a value of 0.2651 to adjust the size of the sketch. Transform the 2D Sketch into 3D Extrude the scaled 2D sketch to 3D using the euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. Determine the appropriate extrusion amounts based on the following properties: - Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.1875 - Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.1875 Following these instructions should result in the desired cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom.
