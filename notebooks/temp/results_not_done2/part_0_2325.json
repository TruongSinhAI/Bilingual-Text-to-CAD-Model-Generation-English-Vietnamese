    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Sloped Side Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is centered on a white background. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.1769]. Next, create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw the first line starting at [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.0]. This line is the base for the sloped side. For the second line, start at [0.75, 0.0] and end at [0.75, 0.0283]. Continue by drawing a line starting at [0.75, 0.0283] and ending at [0.0, 0.0283], which completes the sloped side. The final line returns to the original point, connecting the sloped side to the base: starting at [0.0, 0.0283] and ending at [0.0, 0.0]. Now, scale the 2D sketch by 0.75, as specified in the sketch scaling parameter. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. For the extrusion depth towards the normal, specify 0.0884 and for the extrusion depth opposite the normal, also specify 0.0884. Use a sketch scaling factor of 0.75. The boolean operation applied to the current part is a NewBodyFeatureOperation as it leads to the creation of a new solid body. The resulting rectangular prism has a base with dimensions of 0.75 units in length and width, and a sloped side with the same dimensions and a height of 0.1769 units.</description>",
