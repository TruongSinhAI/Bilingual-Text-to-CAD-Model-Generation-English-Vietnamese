The cylindrical shape should have a diameter slightly larger than the prism's width and a height of 0.75 units. The cylindrical shape should be positioned at a 45-degree angle from the horizontal. The resulting shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism is positioned at a 45-degree angle with dimensions 0.75L x 0.75W x 0.15H, where L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height.
