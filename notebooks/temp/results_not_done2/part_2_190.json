However, the JSON's `loop_1` contains 12 `line` entities, not `arc` entities. This is a fundamental mismatch in the geometric primitive used for the sketch. The points for these 12 lines in the JSON also do not obviously correspond to a simple rectangle with rounded corners as described, but rather a more complex polygon.

This implies an additional transformation applied to the sketch *after* scaling and *before* extrusion, with different Euler angles than the initial coordinate system. The JSON, however, only defines one set of Euler Angles ([0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and a Translation Vector ([0.0, 0.0, 0.0263]) within the `coordinate_system` for `part_1`. There is no separate field in the JSON to apply an additional rotation like [0.0, 0.0, 4.328] to the sketch itself before extrusion. This is a significant discrepancy.\\n\\n-Extrusion:\\n--The extrusion depth (0.1728) and sketch scale (0.75) match the JSON.\\n\\n-Correction: The description's instructions for the sketch geometry (arcs vs. lines) and the additional transformation (separate rotation not present in JSON structure) do not match the JSON's contents.
