    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construction of a three-dimensional rectangular prism Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to -90.0, 0.0, and -90.0. The translation vector should be [0.0, 0.0, 0.041]. Create the first face of the prism's sketch. On this face, draw a loop comprised of three lines: 1. The first line should start at [0.0, 0.2091] and end at [0.2666, 0.0]. 2. The second line should start at [0.2666, 0.0] and end at [0.2666, 0.564]. 3. The third line should start at [0.2666, 0.564] and end at [0.0, 0.2091]. Create the second face of the prism's sketch for a complete prism. 1. This face shares the first loop with face 1. 2. Draw a second loop with three lines, similar to the lines in the previous loop, mirrored along the y-axis: a. Start Point: [0.2666, 0.0], End Point: [0.6883, 0.0] b. Start Point: [0.6883, 0.0], End Point: [0.2666, 0.564] c. Start Point: [0.2666, 0.564], End Point: [0.2666, 0.0] Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6883. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified coordinate system. Extrude the sketch in the normal direction with a depth of 0.1484 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. This will complete the three-dimensional rectangular prism. Part 2: Construction of a cylindrical object with a rectangular cutout Construct a cylindrical object with a rectangular cutout. Similar to Part 1, we begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: 1. Euler angles: -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 2. Translation vector: [0.0, 0.5149, 0.0] Create the face of the sketch for the cylindrical object. On this face, draw a loop: 1. Draw a circle centered at [0.1175, 0.1175] with a radius of 0.1175. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.2351. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified coordinate system. Perform a join operation with the previously constructed prism (Part 1). This completes the cylindrical object with a rectangular cutout. Finally After completing Part 1 and Part 2, you will have created a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The rectangular prism has the following dimensions: - Length: 0.1484 - Width: 0.6883 - Height: 0.6883 The cylindrical hole has the following dimensions: - Length: 0.1484 - Width: 0.2351 - Height: 0.2351 The cylindrical hole is centered in the rectangular prism, effectively cutting away material from the previously constructed prism.</description>",
