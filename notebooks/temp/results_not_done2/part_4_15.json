Draw the second line, `line_2`, from the point (0.3318, 0) to the point (0.3318, 0.5841). 3. Draw the arc, `arc_1`, from the point (0.3318, 0.5841) to the point (0, 0.5841) with the mid point at (0.1659, 0.4182). 4. Close the loop by drawing the fourth line, `line_3`, from the point (0, 0.5841) to the starting point (0, 0). Create the second face, `face_2`, of the sketch: 1. Draw the arc, `arc_1`, from the point (0, 0.5841) to the point (0.3318, 0.5841) with the same mid point as before. 2. Complete the face by drawing a line, `line_1`, from (0.3318, 0.5841) back to the starting point (0, 0.5841). Create the third face, `face_3`, of the sketch: 1. This face is identical to face_2, creating another arc from (0, 0.5841) to (0.3318, 0.5841). 2. Close the face by completing the loop with a line, `line_1`, from (0.3318, 0.5841) back to the starting point (0, 0.5841). Extrusion With the completed sketch, use the provided values in the `extrusion` property to extrude the sketch in a specific direction and add a scaling factor: 1. Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.0149 towards the normal vector. 2. Do not extrude in the opposite direction of the normal vector. 3. Scale the sketch by using the 0.5841 factor. After extruding the sketch and completing the remaining `operation`, the resulting shape should match the `shape`, `length`, `width`, and `height` properties provided in the `description` property.</description>",
