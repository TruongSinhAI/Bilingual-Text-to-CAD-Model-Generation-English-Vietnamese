Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.4687, 0.0] Next, create the 2D sketch for the base of the prism on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch contains one face (face\\\\_1) consisting of four lines: 1. Draw a line (line\\\\_1) from the origin (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.75, 0.0). 2. Draw a line (line\\\\_2) from the point (0.75, 0.0) to (0.2812, 0.4687). 3. Draw a line (line\\\\_3) from the point (0.2812, 0.4687) to the origin (0.0, 0.4687). 4. Draw a line (line\\\\_4) from the origin (0.0, 0.4687) back to the starting point (0.0, 0.0). Close the loop to complete the sketch. The length of this part is approximately 0.75 units, the width is about 0.4687 units, and the height is 0.4687 units. For the subsequent parts, instead of drawing a new sketch from scratch, we will create a new 3D sketch face by transforming the current 2D sketch. Transform the sketch into a 3D sketch using the following 3D orientation and position information: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.4687, 0.0] Line up the transformed sketch with the first part. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75, and then extrude the sketch along the Z-axis. Use an extrusion depth of 0.4687 units towards the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction of the normals. Apply the NewBodyFeatureOperation with the current CAD model. Part 2: Construct a three-dimensional geometric shape with a flat base and a triangular top. Change the coordinate system for this operation: * Euler Angles: [180.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.75, 0.4687, 0.0] Create a new 3D sketch face, transforming the original 2D sketch with: * Euler Angles: [180.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.75, 0.4687, 0.0] Scale the sketch down by a factor of 0.2812. For this part, set the extrusion depths to 0 units towards the normal and 0.2812 units in the opposite direction of the normals. Apply the JoinFeatureOperation, integrating the new CAD model with the previous one. The length, width, and height for part 2 are approximately 0.2812 units each. The final_shape combines parts 1 and 2 for a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom.</description>",
