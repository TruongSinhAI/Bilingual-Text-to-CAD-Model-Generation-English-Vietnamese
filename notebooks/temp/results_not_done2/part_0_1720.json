The coordinate system defines the orientation and position of the 2D sketch. Within this coordinate system, create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. The sketch contains a single face. The face, in turn, contains a single loop (loop 1), which is made up of four lines (line 1, line 2, line 3, and line 4). The start and end points of each line form the vertices of a rectangle. **Step 2: Scale the 2D Sketch** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.7071 (`sketch_scale` parameter). This scaling operation changes the size of the sketch, but doesn't alter its overall shape. **Step 3: Transform the Scaled 2D Sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the `Euler Angles` and `Translation Vector` provided in the `coordinate_system` object. This transformation creates a 3D sketch in the form of a prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model. The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` parameter defines the depth of the extrusion, while the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` parameter defines the depth of the extrusion in the opposite direction. Since these values are both set to 0, the extrusion will only occur in the direction of the normal. The final dimensions of this part are as follows: - Length (longest side): 0.7071 - Width (shortest side): 0.7071 - Height (perpendicular to the plane of the sketched rectangle): 0.0214 **Intermediate CAD Part 2: Rectangular Prism** The second part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The height of the prism is approximately three times the width, and the width is about half the height. The prism is centered in the image. **Step 1: Draw a 2D Sketch** Create a new coordinate system based on the `Translation Vector` and `Euler Angles` provided in the `coordinate_system` object. The coordinate system defines the orientation and position of the 2D sketch. Within this coordinate system, create a new sketch on face 1 and draw a rectangle with sides parallel to the x and y axes. **Step 2: Scale the 2D Sketch** Scale the sketch by an appropriate factor to match the aspect ratio described in the \"description\" object. **Step 3: Transform the Scaled 2D Sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the `Euler Angles` and `Translation Vector` provided in the `coordinate_system` object. This transformation creates a 3D sketch in the form of a prism with a flat top and bottom. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model. The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` parameter defines the depth of the extrusion, while the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` parameter defines the depth of the extrusion in the opposite direction. Adjust the extrusion values accordingly. The final dimensions of this part are as follows: - Length (longest side): (Aspect ratio-dependent) - Width (shortest side): (Aspect ratio-dependent) - Height (perpendicular to the plane of the sketched rectangle): Height is approximately three times the width and width is about half the height.
