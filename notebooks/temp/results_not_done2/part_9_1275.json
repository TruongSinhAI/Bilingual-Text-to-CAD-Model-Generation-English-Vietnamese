    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A rectangular prism with rounded corners First, we will create the coordinate system for this part. Using the given information, set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This sets the orientation and placement of the part in the assembly. Now, let's create Sketch 1 on Face 1 of the coordinate system: 1. Line 1: Draw a line from the point (0.0, 0.0) to (0.5625, 0.0). 2. Line 2: Draw a line from the point (0.5625, 0.0) to (0.5625, 0.2932). 3. Line 3: Draw a line from the point (0.5625, 0.2932) to (0.1875, 0.2932). 4. Line 4: Draw a line from the point (0.1875, 0.2932) to (0.1875, 0.172). 5. Line 5: Draw a line from the point (0.1875, 0.172) to (0.0, 0.172). 6. Line 6: Draw a line from the point (0.0, 0.172) to (0.0, 0.0). This sketch forms a closed loop of six lines, defining a rectangular outline with rounded corners. Note that all points, curves and loops are automatically closed by definition. For the Extrusion properties, set `extrude_depth_towards_normal` to 0.0, and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` to 0.75. This ensures that the prism extends only opposite to the normal direction. Additionally, set the `sketch_scale` parameter to 0.5625 to apply uniform scaling to the 2D sketch, effectively transforming it into a 3D object. Lastly, the operation to perform on this part is to create a new solid body. Although the original JSON specifies \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", the instruction for the junior CAD designer can be simplified to \"Create a new solid body using the scaled and transformed 2D sketch within the defined coordinate system.\" The dimensions of this part are: - Height: 0.5625 - Width: 0.75 - Length: 0.5625 This concludes the creation of Part 1: A rectangular prism with rounded corners.</description>",
