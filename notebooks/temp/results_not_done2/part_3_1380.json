The sketch scale of 0.75, while not explicitly stated for Part 2's sketch scaling, is present in the JSON and common for multiple operations. The operation \"  ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"  ,\" is consistent with the description of \"  ,\"intersecting with the previous extrusion\"  ,\" and removing material.
