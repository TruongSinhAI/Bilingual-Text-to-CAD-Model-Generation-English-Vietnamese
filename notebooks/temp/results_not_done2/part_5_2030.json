The Euler angles should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector should be [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Step 2: Create the 2D sketch Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Step 3: Create the loops and faces For this part, there is only one face (face\\\\_1). On this face, create a single loop (loop\\\\_1) consisting of 4 line segments as follows: 1. line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] 2. line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.3] 3. line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.3], End Point [0.0, 0.3] 4. line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.3], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Step 4: Scale and transform the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system's euler angles ([0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and translation vector ([0.0, 0.0, 0.0]). Step 5: Extrude the 3D sketch Extrude the 3D sketch a distance of 0.0125 towards the normal and no distance in the opposite direction of the normal. The sketch scale should be set to 0.75. The resulting CAD part should resemble a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and an angled front face (45 degrees from horizontal). The part is 0.75 units in length and width, and 0.0125 units in height. The front face should be aligned with the X-Z plane, angled at 45 degrees from the X-Y plane.</description>",
