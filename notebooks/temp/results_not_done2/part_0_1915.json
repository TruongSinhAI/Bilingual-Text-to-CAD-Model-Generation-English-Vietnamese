This will be the base coordinate system for the first part. Now, we will create the 2D sketch for this part on the XY plane of the coordinate system. The sketch will contain one face, and this face will consist of four lines and two arcs. 1. First, create an arc with a start point at [0.0, 0.2027], a mid point at [0.0594, 0.0594], and an end point at [0.2027, 0.0]. This arc will be the first curve in the loop. 2. Next, create a line from the end point of the arc at [0.2027, 0.0] to the point [0.5473, 0.0]. This will be the second curve in the loop. 3. Now, create an arc with a start point at [0.5473, 0.0], a mid point at [0.6906, 0.0594], and an end point at [0.75, 0.2027]. This arc will be the third curve in the loop. 4. Next, create a line from the end point of the arc at [0.75, 0.2027] to the point [0.75, 0.4865]. This will be the fourth curve in the loop. 5. Now, create a line from the end point of the previous line at [0.75, 0.4865] to the point [0.0, 0.4865]. This will be the fifth curve in the loop. 6. Finally, create a line from the end point of the previous line at [0.0, 0.4865] to the start point of the first arc at [0.0, 0.2027]. This will be the sixth and final curve in the loop, and it will close the loop. Next, we will transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following transformation parameters: - euler angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - translation vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] After this transformation, we will extrude the 2D sketch along the Z axis to generate the 3D model for this part. The extrude depth towards the normal will be 0.0568 units, and the extrude depth opposite the normal will be 0 units. The scaling parameter for the sketch will be 0.75. The boolean operation for this part will result in the creation of a new solid body. This part has a rectangular shape with a curved top and a flat bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the sides are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The top and bottom faces are of equal size, and the sides are of equal length. The part is centered in the final shape. The length and width of the part are 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0568 units.</description>",
