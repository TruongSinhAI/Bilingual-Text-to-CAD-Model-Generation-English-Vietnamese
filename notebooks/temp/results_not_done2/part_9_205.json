Both faces contain \"\n      ,\"loop_1\"\n      ,\". This structure is correctly reflected in the JSON.\\n  - \"\n      ,\"face_1.loop_1\"\n      ,\" has six lines, and their start/end points exactly match the JSON. These lines form a closed, complex shape.\\n  - \"\n      ,\"face_2.loop_1\"\n      ,\" has four lines, and their start/end points exactly match the JSON. These lines form a closed rectangle.\\n  - The general description \"\n      ,\"Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with Rounded Corners\"\n      ,\" is a high-level conceptual description; the detailed line definitions are what's being modelled and precisely match the JSON.\\n\\n- Extrusion:\\n  - The extrusion depth is 0.625 \"\n      ,\"in the opposite direction of the normal\"\n      ,\". This correctly translates to `extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.625`.\\n  - The sketch scale of 0.75 is correctly applied.\\n  - The operation is inferred as \"\n      ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n      ,\" which is standard for creating a new independent body.\\n\\nCorrection: No corrections are necessary. The JSON perfectly aligns with the detailed instructions provided in the cleaned description.\\n</think>"
