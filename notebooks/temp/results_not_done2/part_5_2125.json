However, the high-level description of the part (\\\"Rectangular Prism with a Cylindrical Hole\\\") is not reflected in the detailed sketch instructions or the JSON, as there is no hole defined. The count of lines in the description summary (5 lines + 1 arc) is also incorrect, it should be 6 lines + 1 arc, as detailed.
