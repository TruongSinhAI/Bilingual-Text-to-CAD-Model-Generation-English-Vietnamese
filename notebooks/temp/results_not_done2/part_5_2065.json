The sketch_scale parameter should be set to 0.375. The resulting 3D model represents the first part of the final shape, which is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and a flat bottom.

The sketch_scale parameter should be set to 0.18. The resulting 3D model represents the second part of the final shape, which is a rectangular prism with a rectangular hole in the center. Note: The first part of the final shape is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and a flat bottom. The second part of the final shape is a rectangular prism with a rectangular hole in the center.
