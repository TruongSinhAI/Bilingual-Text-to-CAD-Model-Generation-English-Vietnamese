The extrude depth opposite the normal should be 0.0 units. </description>\\n<valid>No</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description refers to \\\"Part 1,\\\" indicating a single part structure named \\\"part_1\\\".\\n\\npart_1:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From \\\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\\").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.1013, 0.0] (From \\\"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.1013, 0.0]\\\").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.3291, 0.0] (From \\\"Draw line 1 from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.3291, 0.0)\\\").\\n----line_2: Start [0.3291, 0.0], End [0.3291, 0.2532] (From \\\"Draw line 2 from the point (0.3291, 0.0) to the point (0.3291, 0.2532)\\\").\\n----line_3: Start [0.3291, 0.2532], End [0.0, 0.2532] (From \\\"Draw line 3 from the point (0.3291, 0.2532) to the point (0.0, 0.2532)\\\").\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.2532], End [0.0, 0.0] (From \\\"Draw line 4 from the point (0.0, 0.2532) to the point (0.0, 0.0)\\\").\\n---loop_2: Not described in the text.\\n--face_2:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.3291, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (From \\\"Draw line 1 from the point (0.3291, 0.0) to the point (0.75, 0.0)\\\").\\n----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.2532] (From \\\"Draw line 2 from the point (0.75, 0.0) to the point (0.75, 0.2532)\\\").\\n----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.2532], End [0.3291, 0.2532] (From \\\"Draw line 3 from the point (0.75, 0.2532) to the point (0.3291, 0.2532)\\\").\\n----line_4: Start [0.3291, 0.2532], End [0.3291, 0.0] (From \\\"Draw line 4 from the point (0.3291, 0.2532) to the point (0.3291, 0.0)\\\").\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1013 (From \\\"Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal direction by 0.1013 units\\\").\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (From \\\"The extrude depth opposite the normal should be 0.0 units\\\").\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (From \\\"Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75.\\\").\\n--operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (Implied by the extrusion operation creating a new solid body).\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check coordinate_system: The Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and Translation Vector [0.0, 0.1013, 0.0] match the JSON.
