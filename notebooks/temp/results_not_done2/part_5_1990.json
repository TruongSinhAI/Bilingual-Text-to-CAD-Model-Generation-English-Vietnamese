While the general intent of a hole is mentioned in the original description, its placement within the single sketch for `NewBodyFeatureOperation` in the JSON is not clearly articulated in the description.

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Central Hole Step 1: Create the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0375, 0.0]. This configuration will serve as the foundation for constructing the first part of the assembly. Step 2: Draw the Sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (face_1) of the coordinate system. A rectangular prism with a central hole will be formed by three loops—loop_1, loop_2, and loop_3—each featuring various curves. Loop 1: Outer Perimeter Loop_1 defines the outer perimeter of the rectangular prism. It comprises of four arcs and four lines, in the following sequence: 1. Arc 1: Draw an arc starting at [0.0, 0.0187], with a midpoint at [0.0055, 0.0055], and ending at [0.0187, 0.0]. 2. Line 1: Draw a line from [0.0187, 0.0] to [0.7312, 0.0]. 3. Arc 2: Draw an arc starting at [0.7312, 0.0], with a midpoint at [0.7445, 0.0055], and ending at [0.75, 0.0187]. 4. Line 2: Draw a line from [0.75, 0.0187] to [0.75, 0.2812]. 5. Arc 3: Draw an arc starting at [0.75, 0.2812], with a midpoint at [0.7445, 0.2945], and ending at [0.7312, 0.3]. 6. Line 3: Draw a line from [0.7312, 0.3] to [0.0187, 0.3]. 7. Arc 4: Draw an arc starting at [0.0187, 0.3], with a midpoint at [0.0055, 0.2945], and ending at [0.0, 0.2812]. 8. Line 4: Draw a line from [0.0, 0.2812] to [0.0, 0.0187]. Loop 2: Central Hole Loop_2 defines a circular cutout (hole) in the rectangular prism. Perform the following steps to create this loop: 1. Circle 1: Draw a circle centered at [0.15, 0.15] with a radius of 0.0187. Loop 3: Second Central Hole Loop_3 defines a second circular cutout (hole) in the rectangular prism. Continue with these steps: 1. Circle 1: Draw a circle centered at [0.6, 0.15] with a radius of 0.0187. Step 3: Scale the Sketch Apply a sketch scaling factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch. This operation adjusts the size of the final part without altering the relative dimensions. Step 4: Extrude the Sketch Extrude the sketch along its normal direction by 0.0375 units and in the opposite direction by 0.0 units. This process forms the rectangular prism with two holes in the top face. Step 5: Finalize the First Part The final dimensions of this part, after scaling and extrusion, are as follows: - Length: 0.75 units (0.75 if measured from JSON data) - Width: 0.0375 units (0.0375 if measured from JSON data) - Height: 0.75 units (0.75 if measured from JSON data) With the instructions above, the junior CAD designer should be able to create the first part: a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section, having two 0.0187-radii holes in its top face. The following part instruction will follow these conventions.</description>",
