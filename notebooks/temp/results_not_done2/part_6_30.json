    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top and Bottom** The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and front and back faces that are parallel to each other. The top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the front and back faces. This part is slightly tapered at the top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.2146, 0.0). This will position the coordinate system for this part. Next, create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. The sketch consists of a single face (face_1). Face_1 contains a single loop (loop_1) that defines the shape of the part. Loop_1 consists of the following lines and their corresponding points: 1. Line_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.2995, 0.0) 2. Line_2: Start Point (0.2995, 0.0), End Point (0.2995, 0.5052) 3. Line_3: Start Point (0.2995, 0.5052), End Point (0.75, 0.5052) 4.

Line_6: Start Point (0.0, 0.7257), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Each line is connected end-to-end to form the loop, and the loop is closed. After completing the 2D sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.75. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the existing coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal by 0.2146 units to create the three-dimensional shape. This extrusion will also result in a slightly tapered top and bottom for the prism. Complete the extrusion with the new body feature operation. The part's dimensions are as follows: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.2146 - Height: 0.75</description>",
