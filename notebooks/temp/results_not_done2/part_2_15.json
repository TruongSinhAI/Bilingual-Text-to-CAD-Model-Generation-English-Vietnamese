We will begin by creating a new coordinate system. The Euler Angles for this coordinate system are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]. This means the 2D sketch plane will be rotated -90 degrees around the z-axis. The Translation Vector for this coordinate system is [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. This means the 2D sketch plane will be translated by 0.75 units in the positive y-direction.
