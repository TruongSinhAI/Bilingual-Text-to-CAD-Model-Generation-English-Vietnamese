lines of specific coordinates). This `face_2` and its geometry are completely omitted from the provided description. This is a significant mismatch.\\n\\n-Check the extrusion:\\nExtrusion depth towards normal (0.0848) matches the description. Extrusion depth opposite normal is correctly inferred as 0.0.\\n--Correction: The description does not mention a 'sketch_scale' value, but the JSON specifies 'sketch_scale': 0.2811. This is a missing detail in the description.\\n\\n-Conclusion: Due to the complete absence of 'face_2' and its associated geometry, and the missing 'sketch_scale' from the description, the description does not fully match the JSON.\\n</think>"
