The height of the object is approximately twice its width. The object is centered in the coordinate system with a slight taper towards the center. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.1978, 0.0] Next, create a sketch on the XY plane. The sketch contains two circular faces (face\\\\_1 and face\\\\_2) with the following details: face\\\\_1: - loop\\\\_1: - circle\\\\_1: - Center: [0.375, 0.375] - Radius: 0.375 face\\\\_2: - loop\\\\_1: - circle\\\\_1: - Center: [0.375, 0.375] - Radius: 0.375 Scale the sketch by 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with an extrusion depth of 0.0391 and an opposite normal extrusion depth of 0.0. Additionally, scale the sketch by 0.75 before extrusion. The resulting shape should resemble a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered shape, narrowing slightly towards the center. **Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Rectangular Hole** Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom and a curved side. This object has a rectangular hole in the center of its side.

Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a circle with its center at [0.0462, 0.0462] and a radius of 0.0462. Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model 1.

Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw two circles: - The first circle with its center at [0.2885, 0.2885] and a radius of 0.2885. - The second circle with its center at [0.2885, 0.2885] and a radius of 0.0462. Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Since the Euler Angles and Translation Vector are both [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], no transformation is needed. Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model 1. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.0865. 2. Set the extrusion depth opposite the normal to 0.0865. 3. Apply a scaling factor of 0.5769 to the sketch. Note that both parts share the same Euler angles and translation vector but have different scaling factors and extrusion depths.

Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model 1. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.5769. 2. Set the extrusion depth opposite the normal to 0.0. 3. Apply a scaling factor of 0.0923 to the sketch.
