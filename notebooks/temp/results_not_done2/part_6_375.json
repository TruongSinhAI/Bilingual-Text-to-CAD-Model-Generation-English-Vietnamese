    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Cylindrical Hole in the Center** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.3788, 0.0]. Create the first face of the sketch. In this face, we will define the rectangular prism's outer dimensions and the cylindrical hole: * Loop 1: * Line 1: Create a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.4182, 0.0]. * Line 2: Create a line from point [0.4182, 0.0] to point [0.4182, 0.65]. * Line 3: Create a line from point [0.4182, 0.65] to point [0.3295, 0.75]. * Line 4: Create a line from point [0.3295, 0.75] to point [0.0659, 0.75]. * Line 5: Create a line from point [0.0659, 0.75] to point [0.0, 0.65]. * Line 6: Create a line from point [0.0, 0.65] back to the starting point [0.0, 0.0] to close the loop. Note that we've defined six lines in total, creating a single closed loop. This loop adheres to the rules: 1. It is always closed. 2. It consists only of lines. 3. No lines intersect with circles. 4. No loops consist of an arc and a circle. * Loop 2: * Circle 1: Create a circle centered at point [0.1909, 0.5364] with a radius of 0.1368. This circle represents the cylindrical hole that will be subtracted from the rectangular prism in the subsequent boolean operation. After defining the loops and curves of the sketch face, we should now have a clear visualization of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. Proceed by scaling the sketch with a scaling factor of 0.75, which can be found in the sketch_scale property. Next, transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the specified euler angles (-90.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector (0.0, 0.3788, 0.0). The euler angles and translation vector are specified in the coordiante_system section. Finally, to generate the 3D model extrude the 2D sketch with these properties: * extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.3788 * extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 Note that these depth values are specified in the extrusion section, following our provided CAD Assembly JSON. Also, there are no mentions of specific boolean operations in this example, ensuring the natural language instructions are clear and concise. Once the 3D model is extruded from the 2D sketch, the junior CAD designer can compare it to the reference height (0.75), width (0.3788), and length (0.75). If the dimensions match, the CAD model is complete and accurate.</description>",
