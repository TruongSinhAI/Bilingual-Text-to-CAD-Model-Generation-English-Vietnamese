The loop of this sketch, loop_1, contains 4 lines, closing the rectangle, as follows: - loop_1: line_1, line_2, line_3, line_4 3. **Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter.** The scaling factor should be 0.75, which corresponds to the sketch_scale value. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch.** 1. Set euler_angles as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], and the translation_vector as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model.** 1. Extrude towards the normal by 0.75 units. 2. Extrude towards the opposite direction of the normal by 0 units. With the given data, the shape's dimensions are the following: - length: 0.75 units - width: 0.75 units - height: 0.75 units Following these instructions will yield a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and the final shape comes entirely from the 2D sketch's dimensions, along with the specified scaling and extrusion parameters.</description>",
