    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: A Long, Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** 1. **Create a new coordinate system:** The first step is to define the coordinate system. The Euler angles for this coordinate system are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0], and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]. This orientation and position of the coordinate system sets the plane for our sketch. 2. **Generate the 2D sketch:** Our sketch will be drawn on the XY plane. The sketch consists of six lines, resulting in a single rectangular face. This rectangular face represents the prism's base. a. Line 1: Create a line segment from the point [0.0, 0.0] to the point [0.0329, 0.0]. b. Line 2: Create a line segment from the point [0.0329, 0.0] to the point [0.0329, 0.0033]. c. Line 3: Create a line segment from the point [0.0329, 0.0033] to the point [0.0033, 0.0033]. d. Line 4: Create a line segment from the point [0.0033, 0.0033] to the point [0.0033, 0.0329]. e. Line 5: Create a line segment from the point [0.0033, 0.0329] to the point [0.0, 0.0329]. f. Line 6: Create a line segment from the point [0.0, 0.0329] to the point [0.0, 0.0]. Note that the successive points of joining define the loop and the order of curve definition defines the orientation of the loop. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch:** Apply a scaling transformation to our sketch, using a scaling factor of 0.0329, to ensure proper dimensions for the subsequent steps. 4. **Transform and Extrude the Sketch into 3D:** Transform the 2D sketch into the 3D sketch using the defined Euler angles and translation vector from our coordinate system. Then, extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the Z-axis to create the 3D model of the prism. The extrusion depth in both directions should be 0.1875. Remember to follow these steps in order to generate the desired prism shape. The intermediate parts will combine to create the final CAD model as specified in the JSON.</description>",
