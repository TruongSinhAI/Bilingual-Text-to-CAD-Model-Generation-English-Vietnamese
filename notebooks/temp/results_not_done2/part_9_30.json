The description explicitly mentions 'CutFeatureOperation' for creating the hole, while the JSON has 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'.

The prism is centered on the x-axis and is slightly offset on the y-axis. **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the Euler Angles set to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector set to [0.0, 0.0978, 0.0]. This will position and orient the sketch plane for the part. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Create a new sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch will have three loops, two squares and one circle. 1. **Square loop 1:** * Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0]. * Draw a line from point [0.75, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.3913]. * Draw a line from point [0.75, 0.3913] to point [0.0, 0.3913]. * Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.3913] to point [0.0, 0.0]. The loop is now closed. 2. **Square loop 2:** * Draw a line from point [0.1223, 0.1304] to point [0.2527, 0.1304]. * Draw a line from point [0.2527, 0.1304] to point [0.2527, 0.2609]. * Draw a line from point [0.2527, 0.2609] to point [0.1223, 0.2609]. * Draw a line from point [0.1223, 0.2609] to point [0.1223, 0.1304]. The loop is now closed. 3. **Circular loop (hole):** * Draw a circle with the center at point [0.5625, 0.1957] and the radius of 0.0652. **Step 3: Apply scaling and transformation** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75, and then transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system properties (Euler angles and translation vector). **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the scaled and transformed 3D sketch along the normal vector with an extrusion depth of 0.0978 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. This will create the rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The height, width, and length of the intermediate part are 0.75, 0.0978, and 0.75 units respectively, and the final shape has a height approximately twice the width, a width equal to 0.0978 units, and a length of 0.75 units. The shape is symmetrical along the x-axis and the hole is centered on the x-axis and slightly offset on the y-axis.</description>",
