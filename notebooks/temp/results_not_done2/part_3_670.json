    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: A Rectangular Prism with a Cylindrical Hole** **Step 1: Create the Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0603]. This will create a coordinate system with a rotation and translation that will be used for the rest of this part. **Step 2: Draw the Sketch** Next, draw a sketch using the coordinate system you just created. The sketch will consist of three faces (face\\\\_1, face\\\\_2, and face\\\\_3), each with a single loop. **Face 1** Face 1 has a loop (loop\\\\_1) that consists of four curves: a line (line\\\\_1) from [0.0663, 0.0] to [0.2607, 0.0], an arc (arc\\\\_1) from [0.2607, 0.0] to [0.2611, 0.1659], a line (line\\\\_2) from [0.2611, 0.1659] to [0.0663, 0.1659], and a line (line\\\\_3) from [0.0663, 0.1659] to [0.0663, 0.0]. **Face 2** Face 2 has a loop (loop\\\\_1) that consists of the same four curves as Face 1, but with a different orientation. **Face 3** Face 3 has a loop (loop\\\\_1) that consists of three curves: a line (line\\\\_1) from [0.2607, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0], a line (line\\\\_2) from [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.1659], and a line (line\\\\_3) from [0.75, 0.1659] to [0.2611, 0.1659]. It also has an arc (arc\\\\_1) from [0.2611, 0.1659] to [0.2607, 0.0]. **Step 3: Scale and Transform the Sketch** Use the scaling parameter sketch\\\\_scale to scale the sketch. In this case, the scaling parameter is set to 0.75. Once the sketch is scaled, use the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system to transform the sketch into a 3D sketch. **Step 4: Extrude the Sketch** Finally, extrude the sketch along its normal direction to a depth of 0.0603 units to create a 3D model. The resulting shape is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. The prism has a flat base and a flat top, and the cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height, and the cylindrical hole has a diameter of 0.5 units.</description>",

Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector from the CAD assembly JSON's \"coordinate\\\\_system\" information. Now, proceed with the extrusion step of the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model. Based on the JSON, use both `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.1875) and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.1875) for the extrusion depths. After completing these steps, you will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.
