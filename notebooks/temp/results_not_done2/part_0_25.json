    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Cylindrical Object with a Flat Top, Bottom, and Central Hole The first part of the assembly is a cylindrical object with a flat top, flat bottom, and a central hole. The shape is determined by the given description and the sketch data. We will create the coordinate system, sketch the 2D shapes, and then extrude them to form the 3D object. Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and the translation vector `[0.1098, 0.25, 0.1098]`. This will position and orient the object according to the provided data. Sketch: Face 1 On the XY plane of the newly created coordinate system, create a new sketch and follow these steps: 1. Face 1 1. Loop 1 1. Arc 1: Starting at `[0.2652, 0.529]`, with a midpoint of `[0.4965, 0.4594]` and ending at `[0.6402, 0.2652]`. 2. Arc 2: Starting at `[0.6402, 0.2652]`, going through the origin `[0.0, 0.0]`, and ending at `[0.2652, 0.6402]`. 3. Line 1: Starting at `[0.2652, 0.6402]` and ending at `[0.2652, 0.529]`. 2. Loop 2 1. Circle 1: Centered at `[0.2652, 0.2652]` with a radius of `0.0312`. This will create the 2D shape on the XY plane. Make sure to connect the arcs, lines and circles in a way that the loops are closed. Extrusion Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6402, then extrude the sketch along the Z-axis for a depth of 0.25 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal. This will form the 3D object as described in the given data. The length of this part is 0.6402, the width is 0.25, and the height is 0.6402. Note that height is determined by the extrusion depth. The remaining parts of the assembly will follow a similar explantion pattern, following the given data in the CAD Assembly JSON file.</description>",
