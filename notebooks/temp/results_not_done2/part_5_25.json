The line coordinates for both faces match the description exactly.\\n--However, the description states 'Create the first sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Face 1:' and 'Create the second sketch on the XZ plane of the coordinate system. Face 2:'. The JSON structure places both 'face_1' and 'face_2' under a single 'sketch' object, which typically implies a single sketch plane for all contained faces. The JSON does not explicitly specify different planes (XY vs XZ) for 'face_1' and 'face_2' within this single 'sketch' object. This is a functional mismatch, as two faces within the same 'sketch' typically reside on the same plane, unless separate plane definitions were provided per face within the JSON, which is not the case here.\\n\\n-Extrusion: The 'extrude_depth_towards_normal' and 'sketch_scale' values match the description. 'extrude_depth_opposite_normal' is correctly inferred as 0.0. The 'operation' is a reasonable inference based on the description.\\n\\n-Correction: The description implies two distinct sketches created on different planes, each containing a face. The JSON, however, represents these as two faces within a single 'sketch' object, without explicit plane definitions for each face. This structural and functional discrepancy (different sketch planes versus a single sketch container) means the JSON does not fully represent the detailed intent of the description. Therefore, a correction is needed for the interpretation of sketch plane definitions per face in the JSON to match the description accurately, or the description should be clarified if the two faces are intended to be on the same plane within one sketch. Given the current information, there's a mismatch.\\n</think>"
