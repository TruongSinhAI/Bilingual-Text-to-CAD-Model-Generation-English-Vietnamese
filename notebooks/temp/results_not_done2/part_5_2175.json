Start by drawing an arc with a start point at (0, 0.0025), a mid point at (0.0007, 0.0007), and an end point at (0.0025, 0). 2. Follow the arc with a line from (0.0025, 0) to (0.035, 0). 3. Draw another arc on the X-axis with a start point at (0.035, 0), a mid point at (0.0368, 0.0007), and an end point at (0.0375, 0.0025). 4. Continue with a line from (0.0375, 0.0025) to (0.0375, 0.035). 5. Draw an arc on the Y-axis with a start point at (0.0375, 0.035), a mid point at (0.0368, 0.0368), and an end point at (0.035, 0.0375). 6. Connect the arc with a line to (0.0025, 0.0375). 7. Complete the loop with an arc from (0.0025, 0.0375) to (0.0, 0.035). 8. Now, create a second closed loop with four arcs, where the center points of the four arcs are arranged along the Y-axis and the start, mid, and end points of the arcs are along the X-axis. The arcs are drawn in the same order as the first loop. This completes the 2D sketch for the first face. Repeat the process on subsequent faces, following the curvature and symmetry of the model. **Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch** Use the euler angles 0, 0, 0 and translation vector 0, 0, 0 to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.75 units to obtain the final shape of part 1, a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. For the following parts, repeat the process, making adjustments as required based on the coordinate systems, sketches, curves, loops, and faces provided in the JSON data for each respective part. Keep in mind the overall dimensions and boolean operations for each part when constructing the models to ensure they fit together seamlessly in the final CAD model. Finally, use the `sketch_scale` parameter to apply the necessary scaling to each sketch and ensure accurate dimensions.</description>",
