Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0228, 0.75, -0.0435] Next, create a sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. The sketch should have a single face (face\\\\_1) with the following loop (loop\\\\_1) and lines: - line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.293, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.293, 0.0], End Point [0.293, 0.3387] - line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.293, 0.3387], End Point [0.0, 0.3387] - line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.3387], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Close the loop to complete the sketch. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.3387. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0.6253 units in the normal direction to create the 3D model. 2. **Part 2: Prism with Cylindrical Hole** Construct a prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [180.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.2849, 0.75, 0.0416] Create a sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. The sketch should have two faces (face\\\\_1 and face\\\\_2) with the following loops (loop\\\\_1) and lines: Face 1: - line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0699, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.0699, 0.0], End Point [0.0699, 0.0717] - line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.0699, 0.0717], End Point [0.0, 0.0717] - line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0717], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Face 2: - line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.1613, 0.0], End Point [0.2312, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.2312, 0.0], End Point [0.2312, 0.0717] - line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.2312, 0.0717], End Point [0.1613, 0.0717] - line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.1613, 0.0717], End Point [0.1613, 0.0] Close the loops to complete the sketches. Scale both sketches by a factor of 0.2312. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketches into 3D sketches using the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Extrude both 3D sketches separately along the normal direction to create the final 3D model. Extrude the first sketch to a depth of 0.0, and the second sketch to a depth of 0.672 units in the opposite direction of normal. 3. **Part 3: Complex Symmetrical Shape** Construct a complex symmetrical shape.
