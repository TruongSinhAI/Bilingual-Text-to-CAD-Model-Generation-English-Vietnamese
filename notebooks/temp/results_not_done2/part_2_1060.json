The height, widith, and length don't fully correspond to the intermediate shapes' dimensions, revealing the presence of a cut or hole operation. However, this does not require additional explanation in the instructions, as the boolean operation (cut) is only specified in the final shape, not directly in the instructions for creating the intermeidate parts.</description>",
