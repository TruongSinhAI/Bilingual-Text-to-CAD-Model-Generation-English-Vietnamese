    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Slightly Tapered Top Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles [0, 0, -90] and translation vector [0.0, 0.2951, 0.0]. Create the following 2D sketch on the X-Y plane: 1. Draw line 1 from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.581, 0.0]. 2. Draw arc 1 starting from point [0.581, 0.0], with a midpoint at [0.7005, 0.0495], ending at point [0.75, 0.169]. 3. Draw line 2 from point [0.75, 0.169] to point [0.75, 0.3883]. 4. Draw line 3 from point [0.75, 0.3883] to point [0.169, 0.3883]. 5. Draw arc 2 starting from point [0.169, 0.3883], with a midpoint at [0.0495, 0.3388], ending at point [0.0, 0.2193]. 6. Draw line 4 from point [0.0, 0.2193] to point [0.0, 0.0]. Close the loop and scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75, then transform it into a 3D sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the sketch by 0.2951 units along the normal direction. This part will serve as the base for further construction. Part 2: Cylindrical Shape with a Flat Top and Bottom Create a cylindrical shape with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles [180, 0, -90] and translation vector [0.5259, 0.2951, 0.0433]. Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane with the following components: 1. Draw circle 1 centered at [0.1509, 0.1509], with a radius of 0.1509. Close the loop and scale the sketch by a factor of 0.3017. Since this part overlaps with Part 1, set the extrusion depth towards the normal direction as 0 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal direction to 0.1757, effectively creating a cut to form a cylindrical hole. Set the operation to \"CutFeatureOperation\". The final CAD model will consist of the base part (Part 1) with a cylindrical hole (Part 2), forming a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has flat top and bottom surfaces. The cylindrical hole is 1 unit in diameter and 2 units deep. The prism is centered on the cylindrical hole, with dimensions of 2 units by 3 units by 4 units.</description>",
