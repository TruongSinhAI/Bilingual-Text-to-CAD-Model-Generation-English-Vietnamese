Set the Euler angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Sketch Now, create the 2D sketch for this part on the plane defined by the coordinate system. In the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1). On face\\\\_1, create loop\\\\_1 consisting of the following curves: * line\\\\_1: Start Point at [0.0, 0.0], End Point at [0.0349, 0.0] * line\\\\_2: Start Point at [0.0349, 0.0], End Point at [0.0349, 0.0192] * line\\\\_3: Start Point at [0.0349, 0.0192], End Point at [0.0, 0.0192] * line\\\\_4: Start Point at [0.0, 0.0192], End Point at [0.0, 0.0157] * line\\\\_5: Start Point at [0.0, 0.0157], End Point at [0.0087, 0.0157] * line\\\\_6: Start Point at [0.0087, 0.0157], End Point at [0.0087, 0.0087] * line\\\\_7: Start Point at [0.0087, 0.0087], End Point at [0.0, 0.0087] * line\\\\_8: Start Point at [0.0, 0.0087], End Point at [0.0, 0.0] Ensure that each loop is closed, and a loop cannot consist of a line and a circle or an arc and a circle. Extrusion To generate the 3D model, extrude the 2D sketch along the normal with an extrusion depth of 0.75 and no extrusion in the opposite direction. Use a scaling factor of 0.0349 for the sketch.
