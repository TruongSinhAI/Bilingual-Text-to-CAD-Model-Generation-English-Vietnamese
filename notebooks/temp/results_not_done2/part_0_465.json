This sketch will represent the base of the three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Within this sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1). Step 3: Define the Loops and Curves on the Sketch Create a loop (loop\\\\_1) on face\\\\_1 and add four lines (line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, line\\\\_4) to form a rectangle. The loop is always closed, and each line obeys the following properties: - line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.6, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.6, 0.0], End Point [0.6, 0.6] - line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.6, 0.6], End Point [0.0, 0.6] - line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.6], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Step 4: Scale and Extrude the Sketch Scale the 2D sketch using the specified scaling parameter sketch\\\\_scale = 0.6. Then, extrude the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D model. The extrusion depths are as follows: - extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal: 0.75 - extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal: 0.0 Step 5: Combine the Part with the Previous CAD Models Perform a \"Join Feature Operation\" to combine the part with the previous CAD models. This will result in the final shape, a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Summary Create the base shape using two separate parts: 1. A three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners. 2. A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Combine these shapes using the specified boolean operations, \"New Body Feature Operation\" and \"Join Feature Operation\" accordingly, to generate the final CAD model.</description>",
