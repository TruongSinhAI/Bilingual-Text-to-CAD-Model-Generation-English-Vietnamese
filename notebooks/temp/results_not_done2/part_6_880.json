The part is constructed by creating a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of a coordinate system, and then extruding the sketch along the Z-axis of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of one face, and the face consists of one closed loop, which is made up of six straight line segments. The length of the part is 0.75, the width is 0.2727, and the height is 1.0227. The extrusion operation creates a new solid body from the sketch.</description>",
