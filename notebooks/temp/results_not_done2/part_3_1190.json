This will create the first intermediate CAD part, which is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The length of this part is 0.1, the width is 0.1, and the height is 0.75. **Intermediate CAD Part 2: A cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section** **Step 1: Creating the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0].
