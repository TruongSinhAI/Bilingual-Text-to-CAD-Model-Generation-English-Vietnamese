  {
    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.3265]. This will position the coordinate system at the appropriate location and orientation for the first part. Now, let's create the 2D sketch for the first part. On the X-Y plane, defined by the coordinate system, draw a rectangle using four lines. Start by drawing a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0]. Then, draw a line from point [0.75, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.5769], followed by a line from point [0.75, 0.5769] to point [0.0, 0.5769], and finally, draw a line from point [0.0, 0.5769] back to the starting point at [0.0, 0.0] to close the rectangle. This rectangle forms the base of the prism. The sketch contains three loops, two on the outer edges and one in the inner region. Each loop is closed and contains multiple line segments. The first outer loop consists of the four lines just drawn. The second outer loop is formed by connecting the midpoints of the four sides of the rectangle. The inner loop is formed by drawing four smaller lines connecting the points where the larger rectangle's sides intersect with the inner loop. Next, scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.0288 and the sketch scale to 0.75 to create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The length, width and height are 0.75 units, 0.75 units, and 0.0288 units, respectively. Part 2: Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. Create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.3554]. This will position the coordinate system for the second part. Draw a rectangle in the X-Y plane. Use four lines to create the rectangle. Begin with a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0]. Continue by drawing a line from point [0.75, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0577], followed by a line from point [0.75, 0.0577] back to point [0.0, 0.0577], and finally, draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0577] back to the starting point [0.0, 0.0]. This rectangle forms the base of the prism. The sketch contains one large loop consisting of the four lines just drawn. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.0288 and the sketch scale to 0.75. To create the curved side, use a variable depth profile, with the depth varying linearly from 0 at the beginning of the curve to the full extrusion depth at the end of the curve. The length, width, and height are 0.75 units, 0.75 units, and 0.0288 units, respectively. These instructions will enable the junior CAD designer to generate the desired rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side, following the given dimensions. The designer should ensure the final shape is accurately positioned and aligned with the specified coordinate system. The second part builds upon the first by adding a curved side, while maintaining the shape and dimensions of the original rectangular prism defined in part 1.</description>",
