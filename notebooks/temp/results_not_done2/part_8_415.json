The final shape of part 1 is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom. The top and bottom edges are parallel to each other. The top and bottom faces of the prism are perpendicular to the sides of the prism. The sides of the prism are parallel to each other. The top and bottom faces of the prism are perpendicular to the sides of the prism. The length and width of part 1 are each 0.75 units (0.75 to be exact), and the height is 0.1962 units. The final shape is created by a 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', where materials are added.</description>",

Set the Euler angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.375, 0.0, 0.0]. This will orient the sketch plane at the desired angle and position it correctly. Step 2: Create the 2D sketch Create a 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. Within this sketch, draw a rectangle divided into four lines as follows: - Line 1: Start point at [0.0, 0.0], end point at [0.3375, 0.0] - Line 2: Start point at [0.3375, 0.0], end point at [0.3375, 0.5025] - Line 3: Start point at [0.3375, 0.5025], end point at [0.0, 0.5025] - Line 4: Start point at [0.0, 0.5025], end point at [0.0, 0.0] These lines form a closed loop that defines the perimeter of the base sketch. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Using a scaling factor of 0.5025, apply the scaling operation to the 2D sketch. This adjusted scale will be applied to the height and width dimensions, making the sketch more manageable for transformations.
