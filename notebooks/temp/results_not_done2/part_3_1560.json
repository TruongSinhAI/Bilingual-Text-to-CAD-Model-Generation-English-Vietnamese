Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 2. Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0417 units towards the normal and 0.0 units opposite the normal. 3. This will create a new body representing the first part of the final shape, a rectangular prism with a tapered top and bottom. 4. The length of the top face is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0417 units. 5. The top and bottom faces are flat and parallel to each other, and the top face is perpendicular to the bottom face. 6. The length of the bottom face is half the length of the top face, i.e., 0.375 units. 7. The height of the prism is the same as the length of the top face, i.e., 0.0417 units. 8. The width of the prism is the same as the length of the bottom face, i.e., 0.375 units. 9. The top and bottom faces are flat and parallel to each other. Note: The above instructions provide the necessary steps to generate the parametric CAD model for the first part of the final shape. The same process should be repeated for the subsequent parts, with the necessary adjustments to the coordinate system, sketch, and extrusion parameters to achieve the desired final shape.</description>",
