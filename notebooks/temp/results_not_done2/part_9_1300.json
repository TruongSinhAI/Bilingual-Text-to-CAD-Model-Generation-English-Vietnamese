Now, let's create the first face of the prism. Create a new sketch on this coordinate system, and sketch a rectangle with four lines. * Line 1: Start point at 0.0, 0.0 and end point at 0.75, 0.0. * Line 2: Start point at 0.75, 0.0 and end point at 0.75, 0.75. * Line 3: Start point at 0.75, 0.75 and end point at 0.0, 0.75. * Line 4: Start point at 0.0, 0.75 and end point at 0.0, 0.0. Note that your final sketch should have one closed loop with 4 lines. Extruding the sketch Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with a depth of 0.0312 units. Part 2: Create a cylindrical hole Creating the coordinate system Create a new coordinate system at the location of the front-bottom-center (0.3125, 0.3125, 0.0312) of part 1 with the following euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Sketching the cylindrical hole Create a new sketch on the coordinate system. Now, let's create a circle at the center of the front face of the prism: * Circle: Center at 0.0625, 0.0625, 0 with radius of 0.0625 units. Extruding the sketch and applying the Boolean operation Extrude the circle along the normal direction in a negative depth of 0.1562 units (opposite normal direction) to create a cut. This will form a cylindrical hole in the prism. **Height:** 0.1562 units **Width:** 0.125 units **Length:** 0.125 units The result should be a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center located on the front face. The height of the prism is 0.0312 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the length is 0.75 units.</description>",

Extrude the Sketch Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by a distance of 0.2655 units. This creates a cylindrical shape with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Part 2 Copy the Sketch of Part 1 Copy the scaled, transformed, and extruded sketch from Part 1. Change the Extrusion Depth Extrude the copied sketch along the negative Z-axis by a distance of 0.2854 units. This extends the cylindrical shape downward. Join the New Body with Part 1 Join the new body created from the previous step with the body from Part 1. This combines the two shapes into a singular object. Scale the New Body Scale the new body by a factor of 0.1991. This preserves the proportions while adjusting the overall dimensions of the final shape. Final Shape The final shape is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom, slightly tilted to the right. The overall dimensions have a length of approximately 0.1991 units, a width of approximately 0.2854 units, and a height of about 0.5509 units.
