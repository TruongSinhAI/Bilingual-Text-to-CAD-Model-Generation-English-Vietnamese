    "prompt": "<description>**CAD Modeling Instructions** **Part 1: A Cylindrical Object with a Flat Top and Bottom** The first part of the CAD assembly is a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. 1. **Create a coordinate system.** Position the coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with no rotation. 2. **Draw the 2D sketch.** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (face_1) of the coordinate system. Draw a circle (circle_1) with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch.** Apply a uniform scale of 0.75 to the sketch. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch.** Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.75 units, creating a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. The height of the cylindrical object is approximately twice the diameter of the base. The length and width of this part measure 0.75 units each, while its height is also 0.75 units. **Part 2 and Subsequent Parts:** Due to the unavailability of information for parts 2 and beyond, I cannot provide specific modeling instructions. However, I will list the procedure and what you can expect to find for each part: 1. **Create a coordinate system.** Similar to Part 1, position each coordinate system appropriately in 3D space using the given 'Translation Vector' and 'Euler Angles'. 2. **Draw the 2D sketch.** Create a new sketch on the specified plane of the coordinate system. Each sketch may contain multiple faces (face_1, face_2, etc.) with multiple loops (loop_1, loop_2, etc.). Each loop can have lines, arcs, and circles. Count the number of curves in each loop if there are multiple. Make sure that a loop is always closed, and it can consist only of lines and/or arcs, but not a combination of arcs/lines with circles or other shapes. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch.** Apply the given 'sketch_scale' to the sketch. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch.** Extrude the sketch along the specified direction, applying the positive or negative 'extrude_depth_towards_normal' according to the desired result (cut or add material). The 'operation' property (CutFeatureOperation, IntersectFeatureOperation, JoinFeatureOperation, NewBodyFeatureOperation) can be interpreted using the following descriptions for constructing the part in the context of existing parts or the final shape: - CutFeatureOperation: Remove a part of the existing models using the current part. - IntersectFeatureOperation: Create a model from the intersecting volume of the existing models and the current part. - JoinFeatureOperation: Add the current part to the existing models. - NewBodyFeatureOperation: Create a new solid body as the current part. After completing all parts, inspect the final shape for the correct height, width, and length. Ensure that all dimensions are in accordance with the given 'description' and adhere to any applicable tolerances or requirements.</description>",

The prism will be centered on the white background with a slight offset of 0.0469 units in the y-direction. **Step 2: Create the 2D Sketch** In the xy-plane of the defined coordinate system, create a new sketch with a rectangular shape as follows: - Draw a line (line_1) from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.6562, 0.0]. - Draw a line (line_2) from point [0.6562, 0.0] to point [0.6562, 0.75]. - Draw a line (line_3) from point [0.6562, 0.75] to point [0.0, 0.75]. - Close the loop (loop_1) by drawing a line (line_4) from point [0.0, 0.75] back to point [0.0, 0.0]. **Step 3: Transform the Sketch to 3D** Apply the scaling parameter to scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75.
