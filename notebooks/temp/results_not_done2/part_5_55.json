Depth towards normal: 0.45 units 2. Depth opposite normal: 0 units These operations will result in the creation of a new solid body representing the first part, which is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Dimensions The final dimensions of the prism are: 1. Length: 0.75 units 2. Width: 0.75 units 3.
