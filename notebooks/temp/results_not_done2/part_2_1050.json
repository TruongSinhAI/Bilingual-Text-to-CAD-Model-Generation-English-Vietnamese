The JSON correctly groups \"  \n  ,  \"loop_1\"  \n  ,  \", \"  \n  ,  \"loop_2\"  \n  ,  \", and \"  \n  ,  \"loop_3\"  \n  ,  \" under \"  \n  ,  \"face_1\"  \n  ,  \".\\n  - Loop 1 (rectangle): The four lines connect sequentially and close the loop. All start and end points match the description.\\n  - Loop 2 (circle): The center and radius values match the description. This will form a circular hole within the plate.\\n  - Loop 3 (two arcs): Arc 1's end point is Arc 2's start point, and Arc 2's end point is Arc 1's start point, ensuring a closed loop formed by the two arcs. All points (start, mid, end) match the description. This will form another hole within the plate.\\n  - The combination of a main rectangular loop and two inner closed loops (one circle, one formed by arcs) is standard for creating a plate with cutouts by extrusion. The inner loops define areas to be removed from the main shape during the extrusion if they are within the outer loop.\\n\\n- Part 1 Extrusion Check:\\n  - The \"  \n  ,  \"extrude_depth_towards_normal\"  \n  ,  \" (0.1139), \"  \n  ,  \"extrude_depth_opposite_normal\"  \n  ,  \" (0.0), and \"  \n  ,  \"sketch_scale\"  \n  ,  \" (0.75) values are exact matches to the description.
