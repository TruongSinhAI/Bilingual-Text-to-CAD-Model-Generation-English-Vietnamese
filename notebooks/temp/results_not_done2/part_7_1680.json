Part 2 and Beyond Following the same template as Part 1, provide instructions for constructing additional parts based on the \"CAD Assembly JSON\". Provide each part with a unique shape, coordinate system, and scaling if necessary. Avoid repeating instructions for common steps (such as creating a new sketch or coordinate system). When referencing points, lengths, or other dimensions, ensure that they are specific to each part. Use clear, concise language and headings to distinguish between parts and operations, while ensuring the instructions remain natural and easy to follow.</description>",
