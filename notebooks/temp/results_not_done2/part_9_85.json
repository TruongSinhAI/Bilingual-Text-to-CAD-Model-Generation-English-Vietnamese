Start by drawing a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.0). Then, draw a line from (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.75). Next, draw a line from (0.75, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75), and finally draw a line from (0.0, 0.75) back to the starting point (0.0, 0.0). This 2D sketch defines a 75% scaled square. Step 3: Scale and transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Scale the 2D sketch to 75% and transform it into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and the translation vector specified in the coordinate system. Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along its normal by a distance of 0.75 units. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism.

Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch Draw the first 2D sketch on the X-Y plane.
