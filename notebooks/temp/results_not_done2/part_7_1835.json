Do not extrude the sketch in the opposite direction of the normal. The resulting shape should be a rectangular prism as described in the \"description\" field. *The length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is approximately 0.0729 units, and its height is also approximately 0.0729 units.* Final Assembly: Now, create a new coordinate system for the final assembly. The Euler angles and translation vector for this coordinate system are not provided, but you can use any appropriate values based on the positioning and orientation required for the final shape, which is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. 1. **Create the 2D sketch for the final shape**: This sketch is not explicitly provided in the JSON, but it can be inferred from the given information. Draw a rectangle with dimensions approximately 1:2 in height and width, connected to a trapezoid with parallel edges approximately in the ratio 1:3 (top:bottom) and a height equal to the rectangle's height. 2. **Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch**: Scale, rotate, and translate the 2D sketch based on the coordinate system created above and in accordance with the given dimensions. 3. **Extrude the 2D sketch in the direction of the normal**: The height of the final shape is approximately 3 times the height of part 1. Once this final shape is completed, the assembly should match the description in the given JSON. *The overall dimensions of the final shape are approximately 1:2:3, with a slightly tapered middle section*</description>",
