Step 1: Create a New Coordinate System Commence by creating a new coordinate system with the following specifics: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.5, 0.0] Step 2: Draw a 2D Sketch on the X-Y Plane Proceed to create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the established coordinate system. This sketch will form the base of the prism. Step 3: Create the Base Rectangle Create the first loop, loop_1, by drawing four lines: * Line 1: Starting at [0.0, 0.0], ending at [0.75, 0.0] * Line 2: Starting at [0.75, 0.0], ending at [0.75, 0.75] * Line 3: Starting at [0.75, 0.75], ending at [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: Starting at [0.0, 0.75], ending at [0.0, 0.0] This completes the first loop, forming a rectangle. Step 4: Create the Inner Rectangle Create the second loop, loop_2, by drawing four lines: * Line 1: Starting at [0.0313, 0.0313], ending at [0.7188, 0.0313] * Line 2: Starting at [0.7188, 0.0313], ending at [0.7188, 0.7188] * Line 3: Starting at [0.7188, 0.7188], ending at [0.0313, 0.7188] * Line 4: Starting at [0.0313, 0.7188], ending at [0.0313, 0.0313] This completes the second loop, forming an inner rectangle within the first rectangle. Step 5: Scale the Sketch Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch. Step 6: Transform the Sketch into a 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the established coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Step 7: Extrude the Sketch to Create the 3D Model Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by a depth of 0.5 units to create the 3D model of the rectangular prism. The operation to be performed is 'Create a new solid body'. Step 8: Review the Part Review the part to ensure it meets the specified dimensions and description: * Shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The middle section is slightly narrower than the top and bottom sections. * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.5 units * Height: 0.75 units</description>",
