Draw a rectangle as face 1, and label it as `face_1`. The rectangle will be drawn on the X-Y plane. 2. Create the rectangle using the vertices of the four lines (`line_1`, `line_2`, `line_3`, and `line_4`). `line_1`: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] `line_2`: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0417] `line_3`: [0.75, 0.0417] to [0.0, 0.0417] `line_4`: [0.0, 0.0417] to [0.0, 0.0] The rectangle acts as the outer boundary for the rectangular shape. Since this is a simple shape without any cutouts or features, this sketch concludes the shape definition. Extrusion 1. Scale the sketch prior to extrusion using a scaling factor of 0.75 (`sketch_scale`). 2. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.0156 units (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`). This will create a solid block with `height` as 0.0156 units. 3. Do not apply any extrusion in the opposite direction of the normals (`extrude_depth_opposite_normal` equals 0). Description The final dimensions of the rectangular shape will be: * `length`: 0.75 units (original sketch `length` before scaling) * `width`: 0.0156 units (original sketch `width` before scaling) * `height`: 0.0156 units (as specified in the `height` property of the description, and also obtained by multiplying `sketch_scale` with the `extrude_depth_towards_normal`).

Both \"\n    ,\"face_1\"\n    ,\" and \"\n    ,\"face_2\"\n    ,\" are nested under a single \"\n    ,\"sketch\"\n    ,\" block. This means, according to the JSON, both \"\n    ,\"face_1\"\n    ,\" and \"\n    ,\"face_2\"\n    ,\" are part of the *same sketch profile* and are extruded simultaneously using the *same extrusion parameters* and the *same coordinate system* defined for \"\n    ,\"part_1\"\n    ,\".\\n  - This contradicts the description, which explicitly states a *new coordinate system* (with a different translation vector) and a *different extrusion depth/direction* (-0.3087 units) specifically for the \"\n    ,\"rectangular hole geometry\"\n    ,\" (which maps to \"\n    ,\"face_2\"\n    ,\").\\n  - Furthermore, \"\n    ,\"face_1\"\n    ,\" and \"\n    ,\"face_2\"\n    ,\" in the JSON represent two separate, non-overlapping rectangles. If they are extruded together with a \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n    ,\" and the same parameters, the result would be two distinct solid rectangular prisms, not one prism with a hole. To create a hole, \"\n    ,\"face_2\"\n    ,\" would typically need to be defined as an inner loop within \"\n    ,\"face_1\"\n    ,\"'s sketch, or it would need its own extrusion operation with a \"\n    ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"\n    ,\" applied.\\n\\n-Conclusion:\\n  - The JSON's structure and parameters for a single part with a combined sketch and single extrusion operation do not align with the detailed, sequential, and distinct steps described for creating the main body and then cutting a hole with separate parameters. Therefore, the JSON does not accurately represent the described CAD process.\\n\\n-Correction: The JSON is not a valid representation of the given description due to fundamental structural and parametric mismatches in defining the main body versus the hole. No corrections can be made to the JSON to match the description without altering its core structure significantly. </think>"
