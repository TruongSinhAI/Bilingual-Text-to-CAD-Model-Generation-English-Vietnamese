The coordinates of the start and end points of each line are consistent with the JSON.\\n- For Part 2, the four lines define a closed rectangular loop. The coordinates of the start and end points of each line are consistent with the JSON.\\n- For Part 3, the four lines define a closed rectangular loop. The coordinates of the start and end points of each line are consistent with the JSON.\\n- All extrusion parameters (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `sketch_scale`) are explicitly provided and match the JSON. The `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is correctly inferred as 0.0 for all parts.\\n- The inferred `operation` for `part_1` as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" and for `part_2` and `part_3` as \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" is logical for creating a primary body and subsequently adding features to it, matching the JSON.\\n\\n--Result: All inferred components and values are consistent with the provided JSON. No corrections are necessary.\\n</think>"
