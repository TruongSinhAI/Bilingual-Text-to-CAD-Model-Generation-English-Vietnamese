    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Construct a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom.** **Step 1: Define the coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Rotate the coordinate system 90 degrees around the X-axis, then rotate it 0 degrees around the Y-axis, and finally rotate it -90 degrees around the Z-axis. The order of rotation is important. - Set the translation vector as 0,0,0 in the X, Y, Z axis respectively. **Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the defined coordinate system** - Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the defined coordinate system. - Draw a polyline with the following lines (specified as a start point followed by an end point): 1. (0, 0.2537) to (0.1324, 0.2537) 2. (0.1324, 0.2537) to (0.1324, 0) 3. (0.1324, 0) to (0.6176, 0) 4. (0.6176, 0) to (0.6176, 0.2537) 5. (0.6176, 0.2537) to (0.75, 0.2537) 6.

(0.0, 0.4743) to (0.0, 0.2537) - Close the polyline. **Step 3: Extrude the 2D sketch** - Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 along the normal (Z-axis) and opposite normal directions. - Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.0441 units along the normal direction. This will create a 3D shape. - This completes the construction of the first part of the CAD model with a length of 0.0441 units, a width of 0.75 units and a height of 0.75 units. Note: The shapes and dimensions described here are as inferred from the provided JSON data. The boolean operation is described as 'creating a new solid body' due to the 'NewBodyFeatureOperation' mentioned in the json data.</description>",
