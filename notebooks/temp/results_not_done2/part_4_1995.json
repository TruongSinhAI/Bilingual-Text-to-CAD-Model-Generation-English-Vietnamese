    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism The first part to construct is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The prism is centered on the x-axis and is slightly offset from the y-axis. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is positioned at a slight angle to the x-axis. Sketching the Base 1. Create a new coordinate system at the origin, aligned with the x, y, and z axes. 2. Draw a rectangle in the x-y plane using the following points as vertices: - Start Point: (0, 0) - End Point: (0.75, 0) - Start Point: (0.75, 0) - End Point: (0.75, 0.3449) - Start Point: (0.75, 0.3449) - End Point: (0, 0.3449) - Start Point: (0, 0.3449) - End Point: (0, 0) Scaling the Base 2. Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.75. Extruding the Base 3. Extrude the sketch along the z-axis by 0.0321 units. Part 2: Sloped Side The second part to construct is a sloped rectangular prism attached to the first part, forming a sloped side. Sketching the Base 1. Create a new coordinate system, rotated -90 degrees around the x-axis and translated by (0.2677, 0.1694, 0). 2. Draw a rectangle in the x-y plane using the following points as vertices: - Start Point: (0, 0) - End Point: (0.2567, 0) - Start Point: (0.2567, 0) - End Point: (0.2567, 0.0321) - Start Point: (0.2567, 0.0321) - End Point: (0, 0.0321) - Start Point: (0, 0.0321) - End Point: (0, 0) Scaling the Base 2. Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.2567. Extruding the Base 3. Extrude the sketch along the z-axis by 0.0321 units, joining with the previous part. After completing both parts, you will have a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The dimensions are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height.
