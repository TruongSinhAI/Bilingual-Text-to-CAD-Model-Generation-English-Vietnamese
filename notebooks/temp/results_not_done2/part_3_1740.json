Set the Euler angles to -90.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees, and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This will position the sketch plane horizontally, facing downwards. **Step 2: Define the 2D sketch** Within the created coordinate system, begin defining the sketch on face 1.

If it's a \\\"Rectangular Prism with a Triangular Cutout\\\", the description of multiple loops would imply one outer loop and one or more inner loops for cutouts. The JSON having a single loop suggests this shape *is* the outer boundary. The description's \\\"triangular cutout\\\" is not explicitly defined in the sketch data. Given the explicit \\\"multiple loops\\\" statement in the description versus a single loop in the JSON, there is an inconsistency in the structural definition of the sketch.\\n- Extrusion: All parameters (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`, `operation`) match the description.\\n- Correction: The sketch structure in the JSON (single loop `loop_1` with 12 lines) does not match the description's explicit instruction for \\\"multiple loops\\\" (lines 1-8 for one loop, lines 9-12 for another).
