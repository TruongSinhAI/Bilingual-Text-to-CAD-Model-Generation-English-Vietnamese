Perform the following steps: 1. Create a new face and name it `face_1`. Within `face_1`, create the following loops: 1. Create the first loop, `loop_1`: i. Create a circle centered at [0.375, 0.375] with a radius of 0.375. 2. Create the second loop, `loop_2`: i. Create a circle centered at [0.1484, 0.6309] with a radius of 0.0185. 3. Create the third loop, `loop_3`: i. Create a circle centered at [0.608, 0.125] with a radius of 0.0185. **Extruding the Sketch** For the base part, we will extrude the sketch to generate the 3D model: 1. Set the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value to 0.0738 and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` to 0.0. 2. Apply a sketch scale factor of 0.75. 3. Perform the extrusion to complete the parametric CAD model for this part. With the provided JSON, the dimensions of the intermediate CAD part and the final shape are as follows: - `part_1`: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.0738 - Final shape: * Height: 0.0738 * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 The above instructions provide a detailed breakdown of every curve, loop, and face needed for the construction of each part and the final shape. It includes the number of curves where applicable, and uses clear, concise language with an imperative tone to guide a junior CAD designer through the process of building the desired parametric CAD model.</description>",
