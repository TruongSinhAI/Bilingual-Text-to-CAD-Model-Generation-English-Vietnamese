    "prompt": "<description>**CAD Model Instructions** **Part 1: Rectangular Prism** Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal and the height is half the width. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0.341, 0, 0) with euler angles (0, 0, 0). Create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. Draw a rectangle with corners at (0, 0), (0.1071, 0), (0.1071, 0.1554), and (0, 0.1554). Close the loop and complete the sketch. Scale the sketch by 0.1554. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using euler angles (0, 0, 0) and translation vector (0, 0, 0). Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with a depth of 0.0836 towards the normal and 0 towards the opposite direction of normals. The dimensions of the prism are as follows: length - 0.1554, width - 0.1554, height - 0.0836. **Part 2: Cylindrical Hole** Construct a cylindrical hole through the prism. The hole is slightly larger than the prism's width. Create a new coordinate system at (0, 0.168, 0) with euler angles (0, 0, 0). Create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. Draw a rectangle with corners at (0, 0), (0.75, 0), (0.75, 0.1071), and (0, 0.1071). Draw a circle centered at (0.375, 0.0535) with a radius of 0.375. Close the loop and complete the sketch. Scale the sketch by 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using euler angles (0, 0, 0) and translation vector (0, 0, 0). Subtract the scaled and transformed 2D sketch from the prism to create the cylindrical hole. The dimensions of the cylindrical hole are as follows: length - 0.75, width - 0.75, height - 0.0236. Position the prism with the cylindrical hole at an angle with its narrower end pointing upwards. The CAD model is complete.</description>",
