Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch With the 2D sketch completed, let's transform it into a 3D sketch by applying the coordinate system properties (Euler Angles and Translation Vector) and scaling the sketch using the provided 'sketch_scale' parameter: - Scale: 0.75 Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch Now, we extrude the 2D sketch along the normal Z-axis by the given distance: - Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.0134 After completing these steps, part 1 (a rectangular prism) will be ready. - Shape: A rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. - Length: 0.0134 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.75 Note: This instruction set contains all necessary steps to construct the part based on the given CAD Assembly JSON.
