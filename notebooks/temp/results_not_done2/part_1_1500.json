The coordinates match the JSON exactly.\\n\\n-Check Sketch for Part 2:\\n  - The lines (line_1, line_2, line_3) are connected end-to-start, forming a closed triangular loop. The coordinates match the JSON exactly.\\n\\n-Check Extrusion parameters:\\n  - All extrude depths, sketch scales, and operations (`NewBodyFeatureOperation` for Part 1, `CutFeatureOperation` for Part 2) are consistent with the description and expected behavior for these types of features in a CAD model, given the assumptions for inferred values (e.g., `extrude_depth_opposite_normal = 0.0`).\\n\\n-Conclusion on Discrepancies:\\n  - The primary issue is the description of \"  \n  ,\n    \"Transforming the 2D Sketch into 3D\"  \n  ,\n    \"  for both parts, which specifies Euler Angles and Translation Vectors for the sketch plane that conflict with or are not clearly layered on top of the `coordinate_system` defined for each `part_X` in the JSON. The JSON's `coordinate_system` is at the part level, defining the overall placement, not an additional sketch plane transformation.\\n\\nCorrection: Due to the ambiguity and contradiction regarding the sketch plane transformation relative to the part's coordinate system as represented in the JSON structure versus the description, the description does not perfectly match the JSON's implied behavior. Thus, the validation is 'No'.\\n</think>"
