Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch Use the established coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector to transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D solid model Extrude the 3D Sketch by a depth of 0.012 units along the normal direction and 0 units in the opposite direction of normals. This step will create a 3D solid model with the provided dimensions. Additional information The resulting shape is a three-dimensional, abstract, geometric shape with a hollow interior. The length of the part is approximately 0.7369 units, the width is approximately 0.0121 units, and the height is approximately 0.7369 units. The instructions follow the shape's construction from start to finish, focusing on creating the base 2D sketch, scaling, transforming it into a 3D Sketch, and then extruding the sketch to obtain the desired 3D model. The instructions are concise and assume no additional knowledge apart from the information provided in the prompt and the examples.</description>",

This sketch should be labeled as Face 1. **1.3 Add Curves, Loops, and Faces to Sketch** * Curve 1: Line from (0,0) to (0.75,0) * Curve 2: Line from (0.75,0) to (0.75,0.75) * Curve 3: Line from (0.75,0.75) to (0,0.75) * Curve 4: Line from (0,0.75) to (0,0) Face 1 should have six loops in total. * Loop 1: Sequential lines (Curve 1, Curve 2, Curve 3, Curve 4) * Loop 2: Circle centered at (0.0286, 0.0286) with radius 0.0143 * Loop 3: Circle centered at (0.0286, 0.7214) with radius 0.0143 * Loop 4: Circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with radius 0.2857 * Loop 5: Circle centered at (0.7214, 0.0286) with radius 0.0143 * Loop 6: Circle centered at (0.7214, 0.7214) with radius 0.0143 **1.4 Scale Sketch** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. **1.5 Transform Sketch into 3D Sketch** Create a 3D sketch by applying the coordinate system's Euler angles (0, 0, 0) and translation vector (0, 0, 0). **1.6 Extrude Sketch** Extrude the sketch along the normal vector by 0.0179 units and in the opposite direction by 0 units. The final shape should be a three-dimensional, rectangular, hollow, metallic structure with a rounded, semi-circular opening on one side, with dimensions of length 0.75 units, width 0.75 units, and height 0.0179 units. **Additional Details** The \"CAD Assembly JSON\" contains information about a final shape and its parts. To generate an accurate CAD model, the junior CAD designer needs information about the curves, loops, and faces in each part. The designer should follow these instructions in order, making sure to create the coordinate system, draw the sketch, add curves, loops, and faces to the sketch, scale the sketch, transform the sketch into a 3D sketch, and extrude the sketch. The instructions avoid using specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation', etc., and focus on the natural language descriptions of these operations instead. Additionally, the instructions include the height, width, and length of each intermediate part and the final shape.</description>",
