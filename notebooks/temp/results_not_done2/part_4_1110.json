This will make the scaled dimensions 0.75 units by 0.75 units. Step 4: Create a 3D solid from the scaled sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D solid by extruding it using the following parameters: * Extrude depth towards the normal: 0.0097 * Extrude depth opposite the normal: 0.0 The result is a 3D solid representing a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The dimensions are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units when accounting for the sketch scale, description of shape and its length, width, and height.
