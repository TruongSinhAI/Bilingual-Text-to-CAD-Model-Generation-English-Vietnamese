This will create a quarter circle in the top right quadrant of the sketch plane. After you've created the sketch, the next step is to transform it into a 3D sketch and extrude it. Set the scaling parameter of the sketch to 0.5. Use the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector to transform the 2D sketch into 3D space. Finally, extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.75 towards the normal, and 0.0 in the opposite direction.
