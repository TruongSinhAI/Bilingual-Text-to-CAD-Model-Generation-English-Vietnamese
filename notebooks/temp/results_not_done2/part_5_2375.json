    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: 3D Model of a Rectangular Prism with a Curved Top Edge The first part is a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top edge. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system with no rotation (euler angles: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and a translation vector of (0.0, 0.1429, 0.0). Sketch Now create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. 1. Start by drawing a line from point (0.0, 0.1429) to point (0.0714, 0.1429). 2. Next, draw an arc with a start point at (0.0714, 0.1429), a midpoint at (0.2143, 0.2857), and an end point at (0.3571, 0.1429). 3. Then, draw a line from point (0.3571, 0.1429) to point (0.3571, 0). 4. Continue by drawing a line from point (0.3571, 0) to point (0.75, 0). 5. Follow this by drawing a line from point (0.75, 0) to point (0.75, 0.3571). 6. Next, draw a line from point (0.75, 0.3571) to point (0.2143, 0.3571). 7. Lastly, draw an arc with a start point at (0.2143, 0.3571), a midpoint at (0.0628, 0.2944), and an end point at (0.0, 0.1429). This sketch has one face, composed of one loop, which contains seven curves (six lines and one arc). Extrusion Now extrude the 2D sketch along its normal direction by a depth of 0.0714 and along the opposite normal direction by a depth of 0.0714. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. The final shape has the following dimensions: - Length: 0.75 meters - Width: 0.75 meters - Height: 0.1429 meters The final shape features of this part are \"A 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top edge\".</description>",
