Set the Euler angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will ensure that the sketch is created in the correct orientation and position. Next, draw the 2D sketch for the first face (face\\\\_1) of the part. The sketch should have a loop (loop\\\\_1) consisting of eight curves. Here are the details of each curve in order: * arc\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0026, 0.025], Mid Point = [0.0, 0.039], End Point = [0.0026, 0.0531] * line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0026, 0.0531], End Point = [0.025, 0.0531] * line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.025, 0.0531], End Point = [0.025, 0.0755] * arc\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.025, 0.0755], Mid Point = [0.039, 0.0781], End Point = [0.0531, 0.0755] * line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.0531, 0.0755], End Point = [0.0531, 0.0531] * line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.0531, 0.0531], End Point = [0.0755, 0.0531] * arc\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.0755, 0.0531], Mid Point = [0.0781, 0.039], End Point = [0.0755, 0.025] * line\\\\_5: Start Point = [0.0755, 0.025], End Point = [0.0531, 0.025] * line\\\\_6: Start Point = [0.0531, 0.025], End Point = [0.0531, 0.0026] * arc\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.0531, 0.0026], Mid Point = [0.039, 0.0], End Point = [0.025, 0.0026] * line\\\\_7: Start Point = [0.025, 0.0026], End Point = [0.025, 0.025] * line\\\\_8: Start Point = [0.025, 0.025], End Point = [0.0026, 0.025] These curves form a closed loop, meaning that the start and end points of all curves are the same. The loop consists of both lines and arcs, and no loop can consist of a line and a circle or an arc and a circle. Now, scale the 2D sketch using the sketch\\\\_scale scaling parameter. Set the scaling parameter to 0.0781. This will ensure that the sketch is scaled accurately and consistently. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. This will ensure that the sketch is positioned correctly in 3D space. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Set the extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal to 0.75 and the extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal to 0.0.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>No</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description refers to \\\"Part 1\\\".\\n\\npart_1: (A long, rectangular, metallic object)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From \\\"Set the Euler angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\\").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (From \\\"translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\\\").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1: (Explicitly mentioned as \\\"first face (face\\\\_1)\\\").\\n---loop_1: (Explicitly mentioned as \\\"loop (loop\\\\_1)\\\").\\n----Curves: The description lists 4 arcs and 8 lines, totalling 12 curves, all with specific start, mid (for arcs), and end points.
