    "prompt": "<description>**Construct the base part** **Part 1: A rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side (base part)** The base part of the final shape is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is centered in the image. Before starting to create the part, ensure that a new coordinate system is created with the euler angles set to (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector set to (0, 0, 0). **Step 1: Create a 2D sketch** Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. **Step 2: Draw the curves** Draw four lines as follows: - Line 1: From point (0, 0) to point (0.75, 0) - Line 2: From point (0.75, 0) to point (0.75, 0.2753) - Line 3: From point (0.75, 0.2753) to point (0, 0.2753) - Line 4: From point (0, 0.2753) to point (0, 0) **Step 3: Create loops** Create a loop with all the four lines. **Step 4: Create faces** Create a face from the loop. **Step 5: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.0816 units along the normal direction of the sketch. The operation is a \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" as it creates a new solid body. **Step 7: Save the part** Save the part as part 1. **Construct the subsequent parts** The subsequent parts build upon the previously constructed parts using the operation defined for that part. **Part 2: Add a floor to the prism** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw a rectangle covering the entire bottom surface of the prism. Extrude the rectangle by 0.2 units along the negative Z direction. The operation is a \"JoinFeatureOperation\" as it adds material to the base part. **Part 3: Add a curved side to the prism** Create a new sketch on the face of part 1 corresponding to the top surface. Draw a circle with its center at the center of the top surface and a radius of 0.25 units. Extrude the circle by 0.4 units along the normal direction of the sketch. The operation is a \"JoinFeatureOperation\" as it adds material to the base part. **Part 4: Add a lid to the prism** Create a new sketch on the face of part 3 corresponding to the curved side. Draw a circle with its center at the center of the curve and a radius of 0.2 units. Extrude the circle by 0.1 units along the normal direction of the sketch. The operation is a \"JoinFeatureOperation\" as it adds material to the base part. **Part 5: Add a hole to the prism** Create a new sketch on the face of part 4 corresponding to the lid. Draw a circle with its center at the center of the lid and a radius of 0.1 units. Extrude the circle by 0.05 units along the negative Z direction. The operation is a \"CutFeatureOperation\" as it removes material from the base part. **Part 6: Add a mounting feature to the prism** Create a new sketch on the face of part 5 corresponding to the bottom surface. Draw a rectangle with its vertical sides aligned with the X and Y axes and its horizontal sides covering a quarter of the width and length respectively. Extrude the rectangle by 0.1 units along the positive Z direction. The operation is a \"JoinFeatureOperation\" as it adds material to the base part. The final shape is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side, with a floor, a curved side, a lid, a hole, and a mounting feature.</description>",
