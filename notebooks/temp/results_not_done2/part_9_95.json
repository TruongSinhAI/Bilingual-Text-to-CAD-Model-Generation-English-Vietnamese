The JSON, however, has *two* circles, one in `face_1` (`loop_2`) and one in `face_2` (`loop_1`), both with the same center and radius. This is a mismatch. The description only supports the circle in `face_2`. Therefore, the JSON has an extra `loop_2` in `face_1` that is not described.\\n  -Extrusion: The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` for the rectangle and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` for the circle (0.0) match. The `sketch_scale` of 0.75 matches. The `operation` \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" is logical for adding a second part.\\n\\n-Correction: The JSON contains an additional sketch element (`part_2.sketch.face_1.loop_2.circle_1`) that is not described in the text.
