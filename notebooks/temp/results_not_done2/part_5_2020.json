Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Sketch: Create a new sketch on face 1. The sketch should have a single face (face_1), which contains a single loop (loop_1). Loop: The loop (loop_1) consists of 4 lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4). The first line starts at 0.0, 0.0 and ends at 0.75, 0.0. The second line starts at 0.75, 0.0 and ends at 0.75, 0.2083. The third line starts at 0.75, 0.2083 and ends at 0.0, 0.2083. The fourth line starts at 0.0, 0.2083 and ends at 0.0, 0.0. Extrusion: Now, extrude the sketch along the normal direction by a distance of 0.2083. The extrusion should not extend in the opposite direction of the normal. Use a sketch scale of 0.75. Part 2: Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered end. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 and a translation vector of 0.75, 0.0677, 0.0592. Sketch: Create a new sketch on face 1. The sketch should have a single face (face_1), which contains a single loop (loop_1). Loop: The loop (loop_1) consists of a single circle (circle_1). The circle's center is at 0.0365, 0.0365, and its radius is 0.0365. Extrusion: Now, extrude the sketch along the opposite direction of the normal by a distance of 0.75. Do not extend the extrusion in the normal direction. Use a sketch scale of 0.0729. This will create the desired CAD model: a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has dimensions of 0.75 units in length, 0.75 units in width, and 0.2083 units in height.
