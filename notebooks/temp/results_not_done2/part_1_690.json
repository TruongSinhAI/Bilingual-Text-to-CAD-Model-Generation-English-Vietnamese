However, the JSON's `loop_1` for part_2 only contains `line_1`, `line_2`, and `line_3`. There is no `arc_1` in the JSON. This is a **discrepancy**.\\n---The lines specified in the description form a triangle (0,0) -> (0.375, 0.5003) -> (0, 0.5) -> (0,0). The described arc would typically connect (0.375, 0.0) to (0.375, 0.5003), but this path is already covered by `line_1` and `line_2` in the JSON's triangle if those were the points of a circle. The description's overall goal of a \"\n    ,\"Central Circular Hole\"\n    ,\" is inconsistent with the triangular sketch defined by the JSON's lines. The JSON sketch only creates a triangular cut, not a circular one.\\n--Extrusion: The extrude_depth_towards_normal (0.0), extrude_depth_opposite_normal (0.5), sketch_scale (0.5003), and operation (\"\n    ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"\n    ,\") values match the JSON.\\n--Correction: The description for Part 2's sketch should be corrected to only mention the three lines (line_1, line_2, line_3) that are actually present in the JSON, and remove the mention of the arc. The overall description \"\n    ,\"Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Central Circular Hole\"\n    ,\" is misleading given the actual triangular cut in the JSON.\\n</think>"
