The sides are parallel and the edges are straight, with dimensions of 3 units long, 2 units wide, and 1 unit tall. **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: 1. Euler angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] 2. Translation vector: [0.0, 0.3409, 0.0] **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the created coordinate system with the following loop: 1. Loop 1: * Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.5114) * Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.5114), End Point (0.0, 0.5114) * Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.5114), End Point (0.0, 0.0) **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75, resulting in a sketch with dimensions of 0.75 long and 0.5114 wide. **Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system properties, i.e., euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and translation vector (0.0, 0.3409, 0.0). **Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a distance of 0.3409 to create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. This extrusion step forms a new solid body, using the \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" boolean operation with the previously constructed bodies.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description focuses on \\\"Part 1\\\", indicating a single part named `\\\"part_1\\\"`.\\n\\npart_1: (Three-dimensional rectangular prism)\\n- coordinate_system: From \\\"Euler angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\\" and \\\"Translation vector: [0.0, 0.3409, 0.0]\\\", we infer `\\\"Euler Angles\\\": [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and `\\\"Translation Vector\\\": [0.0, 0.3409, 0.0]`.\\n- sketch: From \\\"Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane... with the following loop: 1.
