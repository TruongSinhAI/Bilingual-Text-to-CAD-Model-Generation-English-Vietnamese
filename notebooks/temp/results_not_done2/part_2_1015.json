    "reasoning": "<description> Part 1 Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: (0.0°, 0.0°, -90.0°) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.1875, 0.0) Now, we will create a sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. We'll construct a rectangle consisting of 4 lines: * Line 1: Start Point = (0.0, 0.0), End Point = (0.75, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point = (0.75, 0.0), End Point = (0.75, 0.375) * Line 3: Start Point = (0.75, 0.375), End Point = (0.0, 0.375) * Line 4: Start Point = (0.0, 0.375), End Point = (0.0, 0.0) Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Then, transform the 2D sketch to 3D using the euler angles and translation vector of its coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.0938 in the normal direction, and the same depth in the opposite direction to complete the rectangular prism. Part 2 Create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom having a square hole cut through it. Start by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: (0.0°, 0.0°, -90.0°) * Translation Vector: (0.5, 0.0, 0.25) Now, create a sketch on its defined plane and construct a rectangle by drawing 4 lines: * Line 1: Start Point = (0.0, 0.0), End Point = (0.125, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point = (0.125, 0.0), End Point = (0.125, 0.0625) * Line 3: Start Point = (0.125, 0.0625), End Point = (0.0, 0.0625) * Line 4: Start Point = (0.0, 0.0625), End Point = (0.0, 0.0) Since this part represents a hole (negative space) in the final CAD object, do not scale the 2D sketch. Instead, transform the 2D sketch to 3D and extrude using the euler angles of the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch in the opposite direction of the normal (0.375) to create a square hole through the prism from Part 1. </description>\",\n    \"<valid>No</valid>\",\n    \"<think>\",\n    \"***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\",\n    \"\",\n    \"parts: From the description, we have two parts: \\\"Part 1\\\" (rectangular prism) and \\\"Part 2\\\" (square hole).
