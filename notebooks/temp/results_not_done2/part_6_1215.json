    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with Rounded Corners and Edges** The final shape is a rectangular prism with rounded corners and edges, and has three holes on the top surface. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Use the following parameters for the coordinate system: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0265, 0.0, 0.0] Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Begin by creating the first face of the sketch, labeled 'face_1'. Within this face, we will define several loops. **face_1:** 1. **loop_1:** - Create a line from point [0.0005, 0.5928] to point [0.0178, 0.5792]. - Create a line from point [0.0178, 0.5792] to point [0.1249, 0.4951]. - Create a line from point [0.1249, 0.4951] to point [0.1249, 0.1036]. - Create an arc from point [0.1249, 0.1036] to point [0.3321, 0.1036], with mid point at [0.2285, 0.0]. - Create a line from point [0.3321, 0.1036] to point [0.3321, 0.4951]. - Create an arc from point [0.3321, 0.4951] to point [0.298, 0.5719], with mid point at [0.3232, 0.5371]. - Create a line from point [0.298, 0.5719] to point [0.1297, 0.7241]. - Finally, create an arc from point [0.1297, 0.7241] to point [0.0005, 0.5928], with mid point at [0.0, 0.7225]. The loop_1 has 8 curves, namely, lines 1-5 and arcs 1-3. 2. **loop_2:** - Create a circle centered at [0.0657, 0.6579], with radius 0.0184. 3. **loop_3:** - Create a circle centered at [0.2285, 0.1036], with radius 0.023. 4. **loop_4:** - Create a circle centered at [0.2285, 0.4951], with radius 0.0184. After defining all the loops on face_1, move on to scaling the 2D sketch by 0.7241, using the 'sketch_scale' parameter. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given orientation (Euler angles) and the translation vector provided earlier. Extrude the 2D sketch along the positive Z-axis by a depth of 0.0691 units. This will create the 3D solid model. The part_1 dimensions: - Length: 0.7241 - Width: 0.7241 - Height: 0.0691 The 'operation' for part_1 has been specified as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation' in the JSON. This translates to creating a new solid body.</description>",

On this face, construct a larger circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.375 units. Label this circle as circle\\\\_1. Constrain the sketch by closing the loop with circle\\\\_1, forming a complete circle on the face. Create a second face on the X-Y plane (quadrant I). On this face, construct a smaller circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.3013 units. Label this circle as circle\\\\_1. Constrain the sketch by closing the loop with circle\\\\_1, forming a complete circle on the face. Note there are two circles in this sketch. **Extruding the Sketch:** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Rotate and translate the scaled 2D sketch in the coordinate system using the provided euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).

On this face, construct a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.375 units. Label this circle as circle\\\\_1. Constrain the sketch by closing the loop with circle\\\\_1, forming a complete circle on the face.
