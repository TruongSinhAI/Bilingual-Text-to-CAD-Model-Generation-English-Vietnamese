The 3D sketch is extruded with a depth of 0.1367 towards the normal direction and no extrusion in the opposite direction. 9. This completes the first part with a length of approximately 0.75, width of approximately 0.14, and height of approximately 0.75. **Instructions for Part 2** *Shape: A cylindrical object with a rectangular hole in the center. The object is tall and slender, with a smooth surface. It has a cylindrical base and a cylindrical top, connected by a cylindrical shaft. The hole in the center is rectangular and runs through the entire length of the object. The object is symmetrical along its central axis.* 1.
