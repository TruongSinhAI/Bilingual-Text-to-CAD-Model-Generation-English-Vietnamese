    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Creating a 3D Model of a Rectangular Prism with a Smaller Rectangular Prism Offset to the Side** The first part of the CAD assembly is a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a smaller rectangular prism offset to the side. The model will be created using the given coordinate system information and the sketch data. **Step 1: Creating the Coordinate System** Create a new coordinate system using the following properties: - Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) - Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.1675, 0.0) **Step 2: Creating the Sketch** Create a new sketch on the XY plane using the information provided for the \"face\\\\_1\" key. The sketch should contain a series of lines creating a closed loop as follows: - Line\\\\_1: (0.0, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.5) - Line\\\\_2: (0.0, 0.5) to (0.25, 0.5) - Line\\\\_3: (0.25, 0.5) to (0.25, 0.75) - Line\\\\_4: (0.25, 0.75) to (0.5, 0.75) - Line\\\\_5: (0.5, 0.75) to (0.5, 0.5) - Line\\\\_6: (0.5, 0.5) to (0.75, 0.5) - Line\\\\_7: (0.75, 0.5) to (0.75, 0.25) - Line\\\\_8: (0.75, 0.25) to (0.5, 0.25) - Line\\\\_9: (0.5, 0.25) to (0.5, 0.0) - Line\\\\_10: (0.5, 0.0) to (0.25, 0.0) - Line\\\\_11: (0.25, 0.0) to (0.25, 0.25) - Line\\\\_12: (0.25, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.25) After creating the sketch, close the loop. The sketch should have 4 faces—one large rectangular face, two smaller square faces, and one internal face with multiple edges. The length of the rectangular prism is 0.75 units, the width is 0.17 units, and the height is 0.75 units. **Step 3: Transforming the Sketch into a 3D Sketch** Scale the 2D sketch with a scaling factor of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 4: Extruding the Sketch to Create the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch by a distance of 0.1675 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal.
