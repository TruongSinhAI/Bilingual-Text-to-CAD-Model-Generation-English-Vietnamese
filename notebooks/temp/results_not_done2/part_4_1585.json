The part is the base for the final shape. Part 2: Sloped side The second part is the addition of a sloped side to the base created in Part 1. The base and sloped side together form the final shape. Begin by creating a new coordinate system, using the same euler angles and translation vector as Part 1. 1. Start by creating a sketch on the XZ plane. 2.

Translate the sketch so that the bottom-left corner sits at (0, 0.025, 0.75). 6. Extrude the sketch with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0. * This creates a thin sketch at the desired position and angle. 7.
