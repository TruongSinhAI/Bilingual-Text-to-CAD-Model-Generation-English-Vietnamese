The sketch will consist of one face and multiple curves. This face has a single rectangular loop that defines the boundaries of the prism: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.6644, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.6644, 0.0], End Point [0.6644, 0.75] * Line 3: Start Point [0.6644, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] The loop is closed and consists of 4 lines. **Prepare Sketch for Transformation** Scale the sketch using the *sketch\\\\_scale* parameter of 0.75. Apply the scaling uniformly to all dimensions of the sketch. **Transform Sketch into 3D** Define the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0975]. Transform the 2D sketch into the 3D space by rotating and translating it using the given euler angles and translation vector. **Extrude Sketch to create the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis with the following properties: * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.1371 * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 **Boolean Operation** Add this part to the CAD model, adding material, and generating a new solid body.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description focuses on one part, \\\"Part 1\\\", which corresponds to \\\"part_1\\\" in the JSON.\\n\\npart_1: (Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (From description: \\\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\\\")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0975] (From description: \\\"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0975]\\\")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.6644, 0.0] (Matches description)\\n----line_2: Start [0.6644, 0.0], End [0.6644, 0.75] (Matches description)\\n----line_3: Start [0.6644, 0.75], End [0.0, 0.75] (Matches description)\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.75], End [0.0, 0.0] (Matches description)\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1371 (From description: \\\"Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.1371\\\")\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (From description: \\\"Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0\\\")\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (From description: \\\"Scale the sketch using the *sketch\\\\_scale* parameter of 0.75\\\")\\n--operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (From description: \\\"generating a new solid body\\\")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check the sketch loop:\\n--Loop 1: The four lines connect sequentially to form a closed rectangular loop.
