    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism** The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. **Step 1: Create 2D Sketch** - Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with no rotation or translation. - Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane (plane defined by the coordinate system). - Draw a rectangle by creating four lines: 1. Line 1: Start Point (0, 0), End Point (0.75, 0). 2. Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0), End Point (0.75, 0.4918). 3. Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.4918), End Point (0, 0.4918). 4. Line 4: Start Point (0, 0.4918), End Point (0, 0). **Step 2: Scale the 2D Sketch** Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the 2D sketch. **Step 3: Transform the 2D Sketch** - Define the Euler angles for the transformation as (0, 0, 0) degrees. - Define the translation vector as (0, 0, 0). - Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D Sketch** - Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. - Define the extrude depth towards the normal as 0.0221 units. - Define the extrude depth opposite the normal as 0 units. - Since this is the first part, no matching faces are available, and the part will be created as a new solid body. The resulting part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with dimensions 0.75 units by 0.75 units by 0.0221 units. The length is 0.75 units, the width is also 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0221 units.</description>",

Final Shape With parts 1 and 2 combined, you obtain a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Its dimensions are approximately 0.3457 x 0.3457 x 0.1794 in length, width, and height, respectively. Note that the top and bottom surfaces are parallel to each other, and the sides are also parallel. The slightly tapered appearance arises from the subtle difference in width between the top and bottom surfaces.</description>",
