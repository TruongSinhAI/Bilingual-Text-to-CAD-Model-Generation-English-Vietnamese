Next, move on to creating the sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. Sketch on Face 1 This sketch consists of three loops, which are further made up of lines and arcs. Loop 1 This loop starts with an arc (arc\\\\_1) that spans from the Point (0.0, 0.0292) to Point (0.0292, 0.0). The mid point of this arc is (0.0085, 0.0085). This arc is followed by a line (line\\\\_1) extending from Point (0.0292, 0.0) to Point (0.3392, 0.0). The loop continues with another arc (arc\\\\_2) that goes from Point (0.3392, 0.0) to Point (0.3684, 0.0292). The mid point of this arc is (0.3599, 0.0085).

Extrude the 3D sketch in both directions. The extrusion depth towards normal is 0.1875, and the extrusion depth opposite normal is also 0.1875. **Intermediate Part 2: Tapered three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom** Begin by creating a new coordinate system centered at (0.5323, 0.0121, 0.2238) with euler angles of (0, 0, -90). 1. **2D Sketch on Face 1:** 1.1. Draw a line from (0, 0) to (0.1452, 0). 1.2. Draw a line from (0.1452, 0) to (0.1452, 0.1694). 1.3. Draw a line from (0.1452, 0.1694) to (0, 0.1694). 1.4. Draw a line from (0, 0.1694) to (0, 0) closing the loop. **Note:** Each line represents a curve in the loop, thus there are 4 curves in total. 2. **3D Sketch:** 2.1. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.1694. 2.2. Transform the scaled 2D sketch to 3D sketch using the given euler angles and translation vector. 3. **Extrusion:** 3.1.
