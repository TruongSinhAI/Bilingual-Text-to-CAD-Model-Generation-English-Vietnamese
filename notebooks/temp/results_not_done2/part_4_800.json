Set the Euler angles to 0, 0, 0 degrees and the translation vector to [0, 0, 0.3297]. This will position the prism slightly above the origin and align it with the global coordinate system. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Draw a rectangle on the XY plane with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. The first horizontal line should start at point [0, 0] and end at point [0.75, 0]. The second horizontal line should start at point [0.75, 0] and end at point [0.75, 0.2885].
