flow of creating a second body).\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check Part 1 sketch definition:\\nThe description for face_1 and face_3 provides specific line and arc points, which generally match the JSON.\\nHowever, the description states: \"\n                , \"Draw the second face in a similar way, with the points mirrored on the X-axis.\"\n                , \" (referring to face_2) and \"\n                , \"Draw the fourth face, similar to the third face, with points mirrored on the Y-axis.\"\n                , \" (referring to face_4).\\n-Checking face_1 arc_1 midpoint [0.0, 0.0099] against face_2 arc_1 midpoint [0.1233, 0.0099]: A mirror on the X-axis of [0.0, 0.0099] would be [0.0, -0.0099]. The value [0.1233, 0.0099] is not a mirror on the X-axis. This is a discrepancy.\\n-Checking face_3 arc_1 midpoint [0.6267, 0.0099] against face_4 arc_1 midpoint [0.6466, 0.0099]: A mirror on the Y-axis of [0.6267, 0.0099] would be [-0.6267, 0.0099]. The value [0.6466, 0.0099] is not a mirror on the Y-axis. This is also a discrepancy.\\n--Result: The description inaccurately claims mirroring for face_2 and face_4 based on the actual coordinate values in the JSON. Thus, the description does not fully match the JSON for the sketch geometry.\\n\\n-Check Part 1 extrusion:\\nExtrusion depth towards normal (0.2507) and sketch scale (0.75) are consistent. Extrusion opposite normal is 0.0 as inferred and matches JSON. Operation \"\n                , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n                , \" is consistent.\\n--Result: Extrusion parameters for Part 1 are correct.\\n\\n-Check Part 2 sketch lines connection:\\nline_1 (Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.0763, 0.0]) connects correctly with line_2 (Start [0.0763, 0.0], End [0.0763, 0.0198]).\\nline_2 (Start [0.0763, 0.0], End [0.0763, 0.0198]) connects correctly with line_3 (Start [0.0763, 0.0198], End [0.0, 0.0198]).\\nline_3 (Start [0.0, 0.0198], End [0.0, 0.0]) connects correctly with line_4 (Start [0.0, 0.0198], End [0.0, 0.0]).\\nline_4 (Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.0, 0.0]) connects correctly with line_1, closing the loop.\\n--Result: The sketch loop for Part 2 is valid and closed.\\n\\n-Check Part 2 extrusion:\\nExtrusion depth towards normal (0.0397) and sketch scale (0.0763) are consistent. Extrusion opposite normal is 0.0 as inferred and matches JSON. Operation \"\n                , \"JoinFeatureOperation\"\n                , \" is consistent with JSON. \\n--Result: Extrusion parameters for Part 2 are correct.\\n\\n-Correction: The description for Part 1's sketch geometry (specifically the mirroring claims for face_2 and face_4) is inaccurate compared to the JSON values. No other corrections are required.\\n</think>"
