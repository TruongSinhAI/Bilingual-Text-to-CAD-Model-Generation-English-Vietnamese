The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal. **Part 1** **Shape being constructed:** A rectangular prism with a flat bottom and a flat top. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal. 1.
