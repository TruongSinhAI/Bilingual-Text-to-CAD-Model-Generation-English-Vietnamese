    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Creating a Rectangular Prism with a Cylindrical Hole Step 1: Creating the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.0417, 0.0]. This will position and orient the prism on the x-axis and slightly offset on the y-axis. Step 2: Drawing the Sketch On the XY plane, create a new sketch. Face 1 Create a new loop, Loop 1. 1. Draw Line 1 from (0.125, 0) to (0.625, 0). 2. Draw Arc 1, using the points (0.625, 0), (0.75, 0.125), and (0.625, 0.25), creating a curved corner from the right side. 3. Draw Line 2, from (0.625, 0.25) to (0.125, 0.25), to create a straight edge. 4. Draw Arc 2, from (0.125, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.125), and back to (0.125, 0). This creates the left curved corner. Create Loop 2 and draw a Circle 1, with the center at (0.125, 0.125) and a radius of 0.0417 units. This forms the left cylindrical hole inside the prism. Create Loop 3 and draw a Circle 1 with the center at (0.625, 0.125) and a radius of 0.0417 units. This forms the right cylindrical hole inside the prism. Step 3: Extruding the Sketch Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with an offset of 0.0208 units towards and away from the normal. Scale the sketch by factor 0.75. The resulting prism should have the final height of 0.75 × 0.125 ≈ 0.0938 units and a width of 0.0417 units. This part starts as a rectangular prism with two cylindrical holes and the holes are not extruded to the final height.

    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Creating a Rectangular Prism with a Cylindrical Hole Step 1: Creating the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.0417, 0.0]. This will position and orient the prism on the x-axis and slightly offset on the y-axis. Step 2: Drawing the Sketch On the XY plane, create a new sketch. Face 1 Create a new loop, Loop 1. 1. Draw Line 1 from (0.125, 0) to (0.625, 0). 2. Draw Arc 1, using the points (0.625, 0), (0.75, 0.125), and (0.625, 0.25), creating a curved corner from the right side. 3. Draw Line 2, from (0.625, 0.25) to (0.125, 0.25), to create a straight edge. 4. Draw Arc 2, from (0.125, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.125), and back to (0.125, 0). This creates the left curved corner. Create Loop 2 and draw a Circle 1, with the center at (0.125, 0.125) and a radius of 0.0417 units. This forms the left cylindrical hole inside the prism. Create Loop 3 and draw a Circle 1 with the center at (0.625, 0.125) and a radius of 0.0417 units. This forms the right cylindrical hole inside the prism. Step 3: Extruding the Sketch Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with an offset of 0.0208 units towards and away from the normal.
