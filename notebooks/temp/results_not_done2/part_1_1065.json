Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin of the CAD model, with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.4687, 0.0]. Next, create a sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. The sketch should have a single face with a loop consisting of 4 lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.2812, 0.4687] - Line 3: Start Point [0.2812, 0.4687], End Point [0.0, 0.4687] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.4687], End Point [0.0, 0.0] The length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.4687 units, and the height is 0.75 units. After creating the sketch, scale it up by a factor of 0.75, then extrude it through the normal by 0.4687 units. The operation for this part is to create a new body feature. **Instructions for Part 2:** Create a rectangular block with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Start with the same coordinate system as Part 1, but with a updated translation vector of [0.4687, 0.4687, 0.0]. Draw a sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system, consisting of a single face with a loop of 3 lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.2812], End Point [0.2812, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.2812, 0.0], End Point [0.2812, 0.2812] - Line 3: Start Point [0.2812, 0.2812], End Point [0.0, 0.2812] Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.2812, then extrude the sketch through the normal by 0.2812 units. The operation for this part is to join it with the previous body feature. The length of this part is 0.2812 units, the width is 0.2812 units, and the height is 0.2812 units. The final shape of the assembly will be a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. No additional parts or features should be added beyond those described.</description>",

This will define the orientation and position of the 2D sketch plane for the first part. **Step 2: Draw 2D Sketch** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. This sketch will consist of a single face, face_1. **Step 3: Create Loops and Curves** For face_1, create loop_1. Loop_1 consists of six line segments, which form a closed shape. 1. line_1: Start point [0.0, 0.2651], end point [0.1531, 0.0] 2. line_2: Start point [0.1531, 0.0], end point [0.3827, 0.0] 3. line_3: Start point [0.3827, 0.0], end point [0.5357, 0.2651] 4. line_4: Start point [0.5357, 0.2651], end point [0.5357, 0.5357] 5. line_5: Start point [0.5357, 0.5357], end point [0.0, 0.5357] 6. line_6: Start point [0.0, 0.5357], end point [0.0, 0.2651] This loop fully encloses an area, creating a single face. The shape of the loop is a rectangle with a height of 0.5357 and a width of 0.3367. **Step 4: Extrude Sketch** Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.3367 units and in the opposite direction by 0 units. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism. The height of the prism is 0.3367, the width is 0.5357, and the length (determined by the extent of the sketch) is approximately 0.5357.</description>",
