    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The following instructions will guide you through the process of creating this part. Creating the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Drawing the Sketch Now, create a new sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. Follow these steps to create the sketch: 1. Draw line 1 from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.6563, 0.0). 2. Draw line 2 from the point (0.6563, 0.0) to the point (0.6563, 0.75). 3. Draw line 3 from the point (0.6563, 0.75) to the point (0.0, 0.75). 4. Draw line 4 from the point (0.0, 0.75) to the point (0.0, 0.0). This completes the sketch, which is made up of a single face (face_1) and one loop (loop_1). Loop_1 contains four lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4). Transforming the Sketch into 3D Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system provided. Extruding the Sketch Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model: 1. Set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.0078 units. 2. Set the extrude depth opposite the normal to 0.0 units. 3. Scale the sketch using a factor of 0.75. 4. Perform the boolean operation that creates a new solid body. Shape and Dimensions The final shape of part 1 is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, as described in the JSON data: - Shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. - Length: 0.75 units. - Width: 0.75 units. - Height: 0.0078 units.

The designer can follow these instructions to build each intermediate CAD part seamlessly, making the transition to a complete CAD model manageable and efficient. Clarifying the boolean operation descriptions, organizing the instructions with headings and section breaks, and providing a clear sequence for constructing parts help the designer complete the assembly confidently and produce a model that meets the desired specifications.</description>",
