Begin by creating a new coordinate system...** **Part 1:** *Step 1: Create a 2D sketch* Begin by creating a new 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system of part 1. The Euler angles of this coordinate system are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.625, 0.0]. This sketch will be used to create a flat top and bottom for the prism, as well as the sides of the prism. Start by creating a rectangle using two lines: - line 1: Starting point (0.0, 0.5) and ending point (0.0, 0.75) - line 2: Starting point (0.0, 0.75) and ending point (0.5, 0.75) - line 3: Starting point (0.5, 0.75) and ending point (0.5, 0.5) - line 4: Starting point (0.5, 0.5) and ending point (0.375, 0.5) - line 5: Starting point (0.375, 0.5) and ending point (0.375, 0.0) - line 6: Starting point (0.375, 0.0) and ending point (0.125, 0.0) - line 7: Starting point (0.125, 0.0) and ending point (0.125, 0.5) - line 8: Starting point (0.125, 0.5) and ending point (0.0, 0.5) The resulting shape should be a rectangle with a width of 0.625 and length of 0.75. *Step 2: Scale the 2D sketch* Apply a scaling transformation to the 2D sketch using the sketch scale parameter of 0.75. *Step 3: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model* Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Set the extrude depth towards the normal as 0.625, the extrude depth opposite to normal as 0.0. The final shape of part 1 is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. **Part 1 Dimensions:** - The length of the prism is 0.75 units - The width is 0.625 units - The height is 0.75 units</description>",
