Draw a rectangular face (face_1) using the following lines: * Line 1: [0.0, 0.3261] to [0.1793, 0.3261] * Line 2: [0.1793, 0.3261] to [0.1793, 0.0] * Line 3: [0.1793, 0.0] to [0.2609, 0.0] * Line 4: [0.2609, 0.0] to [0.2609, 0.3261] * Line 5: [0.2609, 0.3261] to [0.75, 0.3261] * Line 6: [0.75, 0.3261] to [0.75, 0.4076] * Line 7: [0.75, 0.4076] to [0.1793, 0.4076] * Line 8: [0.1793, 0.4076] to [0.0, 0.4076] * Line 9: [0.0, 0.4076] to [0.0, 0.3261] All the lines are connected, creating a closed loop. **Step 2: Scale 2D sketch** Scale the entire 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. **Step 3: Transform 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector to a depth of 0.1223 and in the opposite direction by the same amount. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch** Now, extrude the scaled and transformed sketch to generate the 3D model. </description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description refers to \"  \n      ,\"Part 1  \"  \n      ,\" indicating a single part in the JSON.\\n\\npart_1: (Rectangular Prism with Rounded Top and Bottom)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from \"  \n      ,\"Euler Angles: -90°, 0°, -90°  \"  \n      ,  \n      \").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.2446, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from \"  \n      ,\"Translation Vector: 0.2446, 0, 0  \"  \n      ,  \n      \").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.3261], End [0.1793, 0.3261] (Derived from description).\\n----line_2: Start [0.1793, 0.3261], End [0.1793, 0.0] (Derived from description).\\n----line_3: Start [0.1793, 0.0], End [0.2609, 0.0] (Derived from description).\\n----line_4: Start [0.2609, 0.0], End [0.2609, 0.3261] (Derived from description).\\n----line_5: Start [0.2609, 0.3261], End [0.75, 0.3261] (Derived from description).\\n----line_6: Start [0.75, 0.3261], End [0.75, 0.4076] (Derived from description).\\n----line_7: Start [0.75, 0.4076], End [0.1793, 0.4076] (Derived from description).\\n----line_8: Start [0.1793, 0.4076], End [0.0, 0.4076] (Derived from description).\\n----line_9: Start [0.0, 0.4076], End [0.0, 0.3261] (Derived from description).\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1223 (Derived from \"  \n      ,\"Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector to a depth of 0.1223  \"  \n      ,\" and \"  \n      ,\"Now, extrude the scaled and transformed sketch to generate the 3D model  \"  \n      ,  \n      \").\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.1223 (Derived from \"  \n      ,\"in the opposite direction by the same amount  \"  \n      ,  \n      \").\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from \"  \n      ,\"Scale the entire 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75  \"  \n      ,  \n      \").\\n--operation: \"  \n      ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation  \"  \n      ,  \n      \" (Inferred from \"  \n      ,\"The first part is a rectangular prism...
