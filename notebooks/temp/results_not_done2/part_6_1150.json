This indicates the extrusion is in the *opposite* direction of the normal. The description only specifies \\\"to a depth of 0.75 units\\\" without specifying direction (positive or negative, or towards/opposite normal). Given the JSON, the description implies an extrusion of 0.75 units in the opposite direction. Therefore, the description is ambiguous or implicitly different from the JSON's explicit instruction. For precise matching, the description should have specified \\\"opposite normal\\\" or \\\"negative Z direction\\\".\\n\\n- Check sketch_scale and operation: These match the JSON perfectly.\\n\\n- Conclusion: The primary mismatch is the explicit direction of extrusion. The description simply says \\\"to a depth of 0.75 units\\\", while the JSON clearly sets `extrude_depth_towards_normal` to 0.0 and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` to 0.75.
