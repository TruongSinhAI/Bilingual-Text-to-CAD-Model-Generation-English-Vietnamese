'Symmetrical depth' typically implies extrusion equally in both positive and negative directions (e.g., total depth 0.0577, so 0.02885 in each direction). However, the JSON has 'extrude_depth_towards_normal': 0.0577 and 'extrude_depth_opposite_normal': 0.0. This means the extrusion is entirely in one direction, which contradicts the 'symmetrical depth' statement in the description.\\n--The 'sketch_scale' value matches the JSON.\\n--The 'operation' type ('NewBodyFeatureOperation') is not explicitly mentioned in the description; it is only implied by the overall outcome of creating a new prism.\\n\\n-Correction:\\n--The description for the 'rectangular prism base' should accurately reflect the components of `loop_1` in the JSON, specifying that it's composed of two lines and two arcs that form a rounded rectangular shape, not just four lines forming a rectangle.\\n--The extrusion description should be corrected to state that it's a one-sided extrusion of 0.0577 units towards the normal, clarifying that it's not symmetrical.\\n--The 'operation' type for the extrusion should be explicitly stated (e.g., 'Operation: Create a new solid body').\\n</think>"
