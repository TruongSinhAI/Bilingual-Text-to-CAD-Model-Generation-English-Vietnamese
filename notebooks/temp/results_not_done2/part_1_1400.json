Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0313 units. Completing Part 1 Once the extrusion is complete, your first part should be a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom.

Completing Part 2 Once the extrusion is complete, your second part should be a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. The dimensions of this prism are given in the description object of the part_2 JSON object. Final Instructions The final shape should be a combination of the two parts produced in the previous steps. Since there are no explicit instructions for combining the parts, evaluate the context of the project to decide the best approach for combining the two parts. Common methods include adding, intersecting, or subtracting the two shapes. Refer to your organization's CAD documentation and standards for guidance on combining shapes. After combining the shapes, adjust the height and width as needed while preserving the part's intended final dimensions. This is the shape described in the final_shape JSON object: \"A rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The model has four holes evenly spaced along its length. The object is centered in the image.\"</description>",
