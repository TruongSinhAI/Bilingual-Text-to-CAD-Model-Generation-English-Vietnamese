For the sketch, create a new face and draw two rectangles, one inside the other. The outer rectangle should have vertices at (0, 0), (0.3618, 0), (0.3618, 0.3618), and (0, 0.3618). The inner rectangle should have vertices at (0.0295, 0.0264), (0.3317, 0.0264), (0.3317, 0.3354), and (0.0295, 0.3354). This results in a square opening in the center of the frame, which is the same size as the frame's width. The first rectangle has 4 lines (line\\\\_1 to line\\\\_4). The second rectangle has 4 lines (line\\\\_1 to line\\\\_4) as well. The square opening in the center consists of 4 lines (line\\\\_1 to line\\\\_4) and is formed by the intersection of the two rectangles.

For the sketch, create a new face and draw a rectangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0.3618, 0), (0.3618, 0.3618), and (0, 0.3618). This forms the base of the prism. Create a new loop and draw an arc with a radius of 0.1809 (half the width of the prism) centered at (0.1809, 0.1809). The arc should span an angle of 180 degrees, effectively creating a curved side of the prism. Extrude the sketch along the z-axis by 0.7236 units with no depth offset. The final shape of the assembly is a rectangular prism with a square opening in the center and a curved side. The prism is positioned at a 45-degree angle, and the hole in the center is cylindrical with a diameter of 1/3 of the prism's width.

After creating the sketch, transform it into a 3D sketch using the provided euler angles and translation vector. Finally, extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.75 units to form the prism. The completed prism has the following dimensions: length = 0.6153, width = 0.75, and height = 0.6153. Part 2: Cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0994, 0.2754, 0.4138]. Create a sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. In this sketch, create a single face and on that face, create loop_1 comprising circle_1: 1. Circle_1: Center [0.1517, 0.1517], Radius 0.1517 Use the euler angles and translation vector to transform the sketch into a 3D sketch. Next, perform a cut extrusion operation. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.8271 units, towards the opposite direction of normals, in order to create a cylindrical hole within the prism created in Part 1. The completed cylindrical hole has the following dimensions: length = 0.3033, width = 0.3033, and height = 0.8271. Upon completion, you'll have successfully created the designed three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 1 unit in height. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of approximately 0.5 units.</description>",
