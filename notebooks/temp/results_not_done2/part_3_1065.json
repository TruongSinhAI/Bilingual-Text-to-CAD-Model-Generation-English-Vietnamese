Step 3: Scale the sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.45. Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.75 units and apply a cut feature operation, resulting in a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center.
