Extruding the Sketch Now that the sketch is complete, extrude it as follows: - Set the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value to 0.15. - Keep the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` value at 0.0. - Set the `sketch_scale` value to 0.75 to scale the sketch before extruding. - The extrusion operation should create a new solid body. The resulting part should have the following dimensions: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.15 The part is now complete, consisting of a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom. The top and bottom edges are rounded, and the sides are straight. The object has a hole in the center of the top face.
