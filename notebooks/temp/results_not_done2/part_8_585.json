If necessary, intersect, join, or cut materials based on the final shape requirements, but avoid using specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation' etc. Use their natural language descriptions instead. Always provide detailed step-by-step instructions stating the shape being constructed. Use clear headings, section breaks, and `<part_num>` tags to distinguish between parts, sketches, curves, loops, or faces. If a loop has many curves, mention how many curves are there. Keep the instructions concise and imperative.</description>",
