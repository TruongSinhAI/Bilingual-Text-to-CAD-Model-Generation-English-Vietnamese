    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Instructions Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The length of the prism is approximately twice the width, and the height is slightly more than the width. The prism is centered on a white background. Create Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and the Translation Vector to 0.0, 0.0251, 0.0. This will establish the placement and orientation of the sketch plane. Sketch Face 1 1. Draw a rectangle on the XY plane using the following points: - Start Point: (0.0, 0.0) - End Point: (0.7516, 0.0) - Start Point: (0.7516, 0.0) - End Point: (0.7516, 0.1566) - Start Point: (0.7516, 0.1566) - End Point: (0.0, 0.1566) - Start Point: (0.0, 0.1566) - End Point: (0.0, 0.0) Extrusion Setup 1. Set the extrude_depth_towards_normal to 0.0251. 2. Set the extrude_depth_opposite_normal to 0.0. 3. Set the sketch_scale to 0.7516. With the base part created, the remaining parts will now build upon it. The subsequent parts share the same coordinate system and reference the previously constructed parts during the addition or removal of material. Part 2 Instructions Construct an L-shaped bracket that intersects with the prism to form a mechanical connection. The bracket has three faces: two vertical faces and one horizontal face that intersects at a 90-degree angle with the prism. Create Coordinate System Same as Part 1. Sketch Face 2 Create a new sketch on the same XY plane. 1. Draw a vertical line starting at point (0.25, 0.35) and extending upwards to a height of 0.15. 2. Draw another vertical line starting at point (0.75, 0.35) and extending upwards to a height of 0.15. 3. Draw a horizontal line starting at point (0.25, 0.2) and extending 0.6 to the right. Extrusion Setup 1. Set the extrude_depth_towards_normal to be the positive difference between the prism's height and bracket height. 2. Set the sketch_scale to 1 (since there are no scale changes). Boolean Operation Perform an IntersectFeatureOperation with the previously created part. This will form the L-shaped bracket where the two shapes intersect. Part 3 Instructions Create an open-faced box that covers the top of the prism. The open face will eventually allow the addition of a transparent window. Create Coordinate System Same as Part 1. Sketch Face 3 Create a new sketch on the XY plane. 1. Offset the top outline of the prism by a small value (less than the bracket's height). 2. Draw a connecting line from the right side of the offset to the prism's right side. 3. Draw a connecting line from the left side of the offset to the prism's left side. Extrusion Setup 1. Set the extrude_depth_towards_normal to the value equal to the height of the prism. 2. Set the sketch_scale to 1 (since there are no scale changes). Boolean Operation Perform a JoinFeatureOperation with the previously created part to add the cover. Part 4 Instructions Create a transparent window that fits into the open-faced box. Create Coordinate System Same as Part 1 but adjust the Euler Angles if needed. Sketch Face 4 Create a new sketch on the XY plane. 1. Draw a rectangle that matches the outline of the open-faced box. Extrusion Setup 1. Set the extrude_depth_towards_normal to the value equal to the height of the open-faced box. 2. Set the extrusion_depth_opposite_normal to a small thickness value for the window glass. 3. Set the sketch_scale to 1 (since there are no scale changes). Boolean Operation Perform a JoinFeatureOperation with the previously created part to add the window. Throughout these four parts, refrain from using specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation', etc. Instead, use their natural language descriptions. With these steps, the CAD designer should now be able to construct the parametric CAD model.</description>",

Step 6: Scale the Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Step 7: Extrude the Sketch Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.562 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal. The resulting shape will be a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel and meet at right angles. Step 8: Determine the Dimensions Determine the dimensions of the prism: the length is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.562 units. Note: The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. The resulting shape is the integration of this part with the previous CAD models, where the boolean operation (operation) may have cut or removed materials, intersected with existing bodies, joined or added material, or created a new solid body.</description>",
