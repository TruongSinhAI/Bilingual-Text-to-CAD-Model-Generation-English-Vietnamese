The sketch will be composed of multiple faces, each containing loops and curves. *Face 1:* Create the first loop (loop_1) on face_1 using the following curves: - line_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.625, 0.0) - line_2: Start Point (0.625, 0.0), End Point (0.625, 0.4375) - arc_1: Start Point (0.625, 0.4375), Mid Point (0.3125, 0.125), End Point (0.0, 0.4375) - line_3: Start Point (0.0, 0.4375), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Close the loop to form a rectangle with a semi-circle at one end. *Face 2:* Create the first loop (loop_1) on face_2 using the following curves: - line_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.4375), End Point (0.1875, 0.4375) - arc_1: Start Point (0.1875, 0.4375), Mid Point (0.3125, 0.3125), End Point (0.4375, 0.4375) - line_2: Start Point (0.4375, 0.4375), End Point (0.625, 0.4375) - arc_2: Start Point (0.625, 0.4375), Mid Point (0.3125, 0.125), End Point (0.0, 0.4375) Close the loop to form a rectangle with two semi-circles at opposite ends. *Face 3:* Create the first loop (loop_1) on face_3 using the following curves: - line_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.4375), End Point (0.1875, 0.4375) - arc_1: Start Point (0.1875, 0.4375), Mid Point (0.3125, 0.5625), End Point (0.4375, 0.4375) - line_2: Start Point (0.4375, 0.4375), End Point (0.625, 0.4375) - arc_2: Start Point (0.625, 0.4375), Mid Point (0.3125, 0.75), End Point (0.0, 0.4375) Close the loop to form a rectangle with two semi-circles at opposite ends, mirrored from face_2. Now, scale the 2D sketch using the sketch_scale parameter (0.75) and transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system.
