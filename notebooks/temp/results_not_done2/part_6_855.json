However, the JSON's coordinate_system for `part_1` is explicitly `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]` for both Euler angles and translation. This is a direct contradiction. The transformation parameters stated in the description do not match the coordinate system defined for `part_1` in the JSON.\\n-Part 2 Inconsistencies:\\n  -Similarly, the description for Part 2 says \\\"Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0].\\\" This again contradicts the `coordinate_system` defined for `part_2` in the JSON, which is `Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and `Translation Vector: [0.15, 0.0375, 0.0375]`. The description's transformation parameters do not match the coordinate system defined for `part_2` in the JSON.\\n-The geometric definitions of the sketches (lines and loops) themselves match the description for both parts.\\n-Extrusion depths, sketch scales, and operations are consistent where explicitly defined.\\n-The title \\\"curved prism\\\" for Part 2 is misleading as the sketch itself is a simple square, with no elements to suggest curvature in its cross-section.\\n--Result: The descriptions for transformations in both Part 1 and Part 2 fundamentally contradict the `coordinate_system` values provided in the JSON for those respective parts. This is a major mismatch that would lead to incorrect CAD generation if followed literally. The shape description for Part 2 is also misleading. Corrections are necessary in the description to match the JSON's coordinate systems, or vice-versa.\\n</think>"
