Extrude depth opposite normal (0.0) is correctly inferred. The \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\",\n    \" is consistent with creating the base part.\\n\\n- Part 2 Sketch Consistency:\\n  - The description explicitly lists the four faces (face_1, face_2, face_3, face_4), each with its loop_1 and 4 lines. The coordinates for all lines perfectly match the JSON structure and values.\\n  - All loops are closed: For example, face_1 loop_1 line_4 ends at [0.0, 0.0], which is the start of line_1, and similar for other faces.\\n- Part 2 Extrusion Consistency:\\n  - The description states \"\n    ,\"Extrude the 2D sketch in the negative direction along the normal by a depth of 0.25\",\n    \", which correctly implies `extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.25`, matching the JSON.\\n  - The sketch scale (0.5) also matches.\\n  - The `operation: \"\n    ,\"CutFeatureOperation\",\n    \"` is explicitly stated in the description and perfectly matches the JSON.\\n\\n- Coordinate System Consistency:\\n  - Both Euler angles and Translation Vectors for part_1 and part_2 are directly specified in the description and match their respective JSON entries.\\n\\nCorrection: All inferred data is accurate and consistent with the provided JSON. No corrections are necessary.\\n</think>"
