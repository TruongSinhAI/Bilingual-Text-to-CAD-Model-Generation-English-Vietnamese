However, it is not explicitly stated in the description, leading to a potential mismatch.\\n\\n-Check Part 2:\\nCoordinate system, sketch details, extrusion depths, and sketch scale all match the description.\\nThe operation \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" is a reasonable inference for a subsequent part to combine with the previous one. However, it is not explicitly stated in the description, leading to a potential mismatch.\\n\\n-Check Part 3:\\nCoordinate system, sketch details, extrusion depths, and sketch scale all match the description.\\nThe operation \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" is strongly implied by the description (\\\"(Cut Feature)\\\" and \\\"extrude along the opposite direction\\\"). However, it is not explicitly stated as an \\\"operation\\\" parameter in the description.\\n\\n-Correction: For all three parts, the \\\"operation\\\" type (e.g., \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\", \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\", \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\") is not explicitly stated in the description's extrusion parameters, although it can be inferred or is mentioned in the part title (for Part 3). This lack of explicit mention makes the description not perfectly match the JSON for the `operation` key.\\n</think>"
