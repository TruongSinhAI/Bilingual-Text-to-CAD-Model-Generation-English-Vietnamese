Use an extrude depth of 0.75 towards the normal and no extrusion in the opposite direction. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides.

Instead of extruding the sketch, we will perform a cut feature operation between the prism and the new body. This means removing a portion of the original prism based on the dimensions of the new body. The tapered prism you create will be subtracted from the original prism.
