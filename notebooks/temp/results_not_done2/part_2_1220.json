This will create the first part of the CAD model, which is a flat rectangular surface with dimensions 0.75 units by 0.0725 units and a height of 0.015 units. The next part will be the cylindrical surface connecting to the flat rectangle. Part 2: Cylindrical Surface The second part of the CAD model is the cylindrical surface connecting to the flat rectangular surface. Creating the coordinate system Re-use the existing coordinate system for the cylindrical surface since the connection to the flat rectangle occurs in the same plane.

The final shape of this part should match the provided \"final_shape\" description. After completing these steps, the CAD model assembly will be complete.

While the geometric data itself is correct, the organizational structure described does not precisely align with the JSON schema for sketch faces/loops. Therefore, the description is not a perfect match.\\n</think>"

Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.3285, 0.0012) Sketching first face 2. Create a new face (face_1) and start a new sketch: 3. Draw a line (line_1) from the point (0.1547, 0.0) to the point (0.6928, 0.0706). 4. Draw an arc (arc_1) from the endpoint of line_1, through the midpoint (0.75, 0.1357), to the point (0.6928, 0.2008). 5. Draw a line (line_2) from the endpoint of arc_1 to the point (0.1547, 0.2714). 6. Draw an arc (arc_2) from the endpoint of line_2, through the midpoint (0.0, 0.1357), to the starting point of line_1. Sketching second face 7. Create another loop (loop_2) in face_1. 8. Draw an arc (arc_1) from the point (0.1844, 0.222) to the point (0.2232, 0.1833). 9. Draw line segments (line_1 to line_4) connecting the points of arc_1 in the following sequence: (0.2232, 0.1833) -> (0.2414, 0.2015) -> (0.222, 0.2209) -> (0.2027, 0.2402) -> (0.1844, 0.222). Sketching third face 10. Create a new loop (loop_3) in face_1. 11. Draw an arc (arc_1) from the point (0.2723, 0.0919) to the point (0.3016, 0.0564). 12. Draw a line (line_1) from the endpoint of arc_1 to the point (0.5656, 0.0883). 13. Draw an arc (arc_2) from the endpoint of line_1 to the point (0.5656, 0.1831). 14. Draw a line (line_2) from the endpoint of arc_2 to the point (0.3016, 0.215). 15. Draw an arc (arc_3) from the endpoint of line_2 to the point (0.2723, 0.1795). 16. Draw an arc (arc_4) from the endpoint of arc_3 to the starting point of arc_1. Sketching fourth face 17. Create a new loop (loop_4) in face_1 and draw a circle (circle_1) with (0.6843, 0.1357) as the center and a radius of 0.0328. Scaling and Extrusion 18. Scale the complete sketch (face_1) with a factor of 0.75. 19. Extrude the face with a depth of 0.3285 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal. 20.
