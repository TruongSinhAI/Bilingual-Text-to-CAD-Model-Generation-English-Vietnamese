Use the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" to create a new solid body from the scaled and extruded sketch. To summarize, construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a triangular cutout: - Create the coordinate system with the given Euler angles and translation vector. - Sketch the base as specified. - Scale the sketch by 0.75 units and extrude it along the Z-axis. - Join the new solid body to the previously constructed parts using a \"JoinFeatureOperation\". The exact operation with the preceding CAD models depends on the CAD software. Please consult the software documentation. Now, we move on to the remaining parts of the CAD assembly.</description>",
