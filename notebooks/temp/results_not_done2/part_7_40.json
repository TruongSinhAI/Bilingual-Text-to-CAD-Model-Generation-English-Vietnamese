The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin of the white background. Then, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. Create a face with a loop consisting of four straight lines. 1. Line 1: Start Point (0, 0), End Point (0.75, 0) 2. Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0), End Point (0.75, 0.75) 3. Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.75), End Point (0, 0.75) 4.

Next, transform this scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the rotation and translation data provided in the coordinate system. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis to create the 3D model. Set the extrusion depth to 0.01 units. This will be your first CAD part. **Part 2: Rectangular Prism with Cylindrical Hole** Construct a CAD model of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism is positioned diagonally from the top left to the bottom right corner of the image. The cylindrical hole is centered on the prism and is slightly smaller in height than the prism. The prism has a flat top and bottom surface. The cylindrical hole has a flat bottom surface and a curved top surface. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the point (0.725, 0, 0.01) relative to the previous part. Then, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. Create a face with two loops: one for the square outline and one for the circular hole. For the square outline loop: 1. Line 1: Start Point (0, 0), End Point (0.025, 0) 2. Line 2: Start Point (0.025, 0), End Point (0.025, 0.025) 3. Line 3: Start Point (0.025, 0.025), End Point (0, 0.025) 4. Line 4: Start Point (0, 0.025), End Point (0, 0) For the circular hole loop: - Draw a circle centered at (0.0125, 0.0125) with a radius of 0.0125. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Next, transform this scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the rotation and translation data provided in the coordinate system. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis to create the 3D model. Set the extrusion depth to 0.25 units, extending from 0.01 to 0.26 units along the Z-axis. This will be your second CAD part, joined with the previous part.</description>",
