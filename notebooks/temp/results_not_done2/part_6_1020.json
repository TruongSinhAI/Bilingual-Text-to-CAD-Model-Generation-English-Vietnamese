Draw a rectangle... 2. Draw two circles...\\\". This implies all these elements (one rectangle, two circles) belong to *one* sketch, likely represented as different loops within `face_1`. The JSON for `part_1`'s sketch has these three elements correctly listed under `face_1` as `loop_1`, `loop_2`, and `loop_3`. However, the JSON also includes `face_2` and `face_3` each containing one of the circles, which is redundant and not explicitly described. The description does not mention creating separate faces for these circles within Part 1's initial sketch. This is a mismatch.\\n\\n-Part 2 Sketch: The description says \\\"Draw two circles\\\" within *a* 2D sketch. Similar to Part 1, this implies these circles belong to the same face (e.g., `face_1`). The JSON for `part_2`'s sketch *only* defines `face_1` and lists `loop_1` and `loop_2` within it for the two circles, which correctly matches the inference.\\n\\n-Part 3 Sketch: The description says \\\"Draw two circles\\\" within *a* 2D sketch. The JSON for `part_3`'s sketch *only* defines `face_1` and lists `loop_1` and `loop_2` within it for the two circles, which correctly matches the inference.\\n\\n-Coordinate systems and extrusion parameters for all parts match the description.\\n\\n-Correction: The JSON for `part_1`'s sketch is incorrect as it defines `face_2` and `face_3` for circles that are already defined as `loop_2` and `loop_3` within `face_1`. The description does not support these extra faces.
