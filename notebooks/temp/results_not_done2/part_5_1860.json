Part 1: Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. For the sketch, create a new face with the following loop: - Loop 1: Create a line with a start point of 0.0, 0.0 and an end point of 0.75, 0.0. - Create a line with a start point of 0.75, 0.0 and an end point of 0.75, 0.6. - Create a line with a start point of 0.75, 0.6 and an end point of 0.0, 0.6. - Create a line with a start point of 0.0, 0.6 and an end point of 0.0, 0.0. This loop forms the perimeter of the prism. Additionally, create a second loop (Loop 2) with a single circular arc. The arc's center point should be at 0.375, 0.36 and its radius should be 0.075. This loop will create the cylindrical hole in the center of the prism. After the sketch, proceed to the extrusion. Set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.09 and the opposing depth to 0.0. Use a sketch scale of 0.75 for this step. This will create the 3D model of the prism with the cylindrical hole. Part 2: Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.09. For the sketch, create a new face with a loop similar to Part 1. This loop should form the perimeter of the prism. After the sketch, proceed to the extrusion. Set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.6 and the opposing depth to 0.0. Use a sketch scale of 0.75 for this step. This will create the 3D model of the prism. Part 3: Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 180.0, 0.0, -90.0 and a translation vector of 0.75, 0.09, 0.09. For the sketch, create two new faces and sketches. For the first face and sketch, create a loop like Part 1. This loop should form the perimeter of the prism. For the second face and sketch, create a loop with four lines. The first line should start at 0.69, 0.0 and end at 0.75, 0.0. The second line should start at 0.75, 0.0 and end at 0.75, 0.6. The third line should start at 0.75, 0.6 and end at 0.69, 0.6. The fourth line should start at 0.69, 0.6 and end at 0.69, 0.0. This loop creates the smaller prism on top of the larger prism. After the sketch, proceed to the extrusion. Set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.24 and the opposing depth to 0.0. Use a sketch scale of 0.75 for this step. This will create the 3D model of the prisms. ... Continue this pattern for the remaining parts as described in the JSON. Be sure to keep each part's instructions separate and organized. Include the dimensions and shape descriptions provided in the JSON for each part.
