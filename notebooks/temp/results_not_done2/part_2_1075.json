The prism has a hole in the center of its top face. **Additional Notes:** - Pay attention to the orientation of each face and the winding direction of the loops when creating the 2D sketch to ensure proper extrusion. - Be mindful of the specified sketch_scale and apply it during the scaling step. - Double-check the specified extrusion depth and direction to ensure proper construction. - The first part's description clarifies the shape of the final object, which is very helpful for understanding the design intent. - Since this is a parametric model, make sure that any modifications to the design preserve the relationships between the parts and features.</description>",
