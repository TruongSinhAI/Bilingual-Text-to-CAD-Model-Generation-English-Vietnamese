Set the Euler angles to 0 degrees in all three axes and the translation vector to (0, 0, 0.0682). Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Start by creating a rectangle using the following lines: * Line 1: Start point (0, 0), End point (0.6818, 0). * Line 2: Start point (0.6818, 0), End point (0.6818, 0.3409). * Line 3: Start point (0.6818, 0.3409), End point (0, 0.3409). * Line 4: Start point (0, 0.3409), End point (0, 0). Create a second loop, also on the X-Y plane, using these lines: * Line 1: Start point (0.0341, 0.0341), End point (0.6477, 0.0341). * Line 2: Start point (0.6477, 0.0341), End point (0.6477, 0.3068). * Line 3: Start point (0.6477, 0.3068), End point (0.0341, 0.3068). * Line 4: Start point (0.0341, 0.3068), End point (0.0341, 0.0341). This sketch should now consist of two faces, each made up of a single loop. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6818. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector (0, 0, 0). Extrude the sketch by 0.6818 units in the normal direction to create the 3D model. Part 2: Create a smaller rectangular prism and join it to the top of Part 1. Create a new coordinate system with the same parameters as before. Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Use the same lines and loops as in Part 1, but scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6818 before transforming it into a 3D Sketch. Extrude the sketch by 0.0682 units in the opposite direction of the normal to create the second 3D model. Join the second 3D model to the top of Part 1. The dimensions of Part 1 are approximately 0.6818 units in height and width, with a slightly tapered middle section. The sides of the prism are straight and perpendicular to the front face. The dimensions of Part 2 are approximately 0.0682 units in height, with the same width as Part 1. The sides of this prism are also straight and perpendicular to the front face. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The dimensions of the front face are approximately 2:3 in height and width. The sides of the prism are straight and perpendicular to the front face.</description>",
