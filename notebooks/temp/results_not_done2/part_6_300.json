The sketch will consist of a single face (face\\\\_1) with the following loop and curves: * Loop 1: + Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.1124], End Point [0.0649, 0.0] + Line 2: Start Point [0.0649, 0.0], End Point [0.6851, 0.0] + Line 3: Start Point [0.6851, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.1124] + Line 4: Start Point [0.75, 0.1124], End Point [0.4399, 0.6495] + Line 5: Start Point [0.4399, 0.6495], End Point [0.3101, 0.6495] + Line 6: Start Point [0.3101, 0.6495], End Point [0.0, 0.1124] The loop is a closed loop consisting of six lines. Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.0659 units to create the 3D model. </description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description specifies a single part: \"  ,\"Part 1\"  ,\" (Rectangular Prism with Angled Front Face).
