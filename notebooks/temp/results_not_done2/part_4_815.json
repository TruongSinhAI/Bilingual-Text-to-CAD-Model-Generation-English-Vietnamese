    "reasoning": "<description>**Part 1: Creating the Base Rectangular Prism** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Now, create a sketch with a single face (face\\\\_1) using the coordinate system. On this face, create a loop (loop\\\\_1) consisting of the following lines: * Line 1: Starting at [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.5, 0.0] * Line 2: Starting at [0.5, 0.0] and ending at [0.5, 0.75] * Line 3: Starting at [0.5, 0.75] and ending at [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: Starting at [0.0, 0.75] and ending at [0.0, 0.0] Proceed with extruding the sketch along the normal direction by 0.3 units with a scaling factor of 0.75, creating a rectangular prism. Make sure to use the \"  \n  ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"  \n  ,\" effectively making this the base part. **Part 2: Creating the First Cut to Form the Hole** Create a new coordinate system for this part with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.3] Based on this coordinate system, draw a face and add a loop (loop\\\\_1) made up of these lines: * Line 1: Starting at [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.15, 0.0] * Line 2: Starting at [0.15, 0.0] and ending at [0.15, 0.75] * Line 3: Starting at [0.15, 0.75] and ending at [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: Starting at [0.0, 0.75] and ending at [0.0, 0.0] Extrude the sketch with a depth of 0.15 units towards the opposite direction of the normal. This will create a second rectangular prism matching the size and position of the first part, but cutting into it due to the opposite extrusion direction. Use the \"  \n  ,\"CutFeatureOperation.\"  \n  ,\" **Part 3: Creating the Central Cylindrical Hole** Create a new coordinate system for this part with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.225, 0.275, 0.3] Draw a circular sketch with a radius of 0.1 at the center [0.1, 0.1] on this plane.
