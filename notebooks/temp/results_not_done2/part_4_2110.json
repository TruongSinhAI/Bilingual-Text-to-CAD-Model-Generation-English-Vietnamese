    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Cylindrical Object with a Tapered Top and a Flat Bottom** *Shape and Dimensions* A cylindrical object with a tapered top and a flat bottom. The top is slightly curved and the bottom is flat. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. Its length is 0.2156 meters, width is 0.2156 meters, and height is 0.4312 meters. *Instructions* 1. Creating the coordinate system Begin by constructing a new coordinate system. Use the provided `translation_vector`, [0.0167, 0.0167, 0.3188], to determine the position of the coordinate system's origin in the global 3D space. The `euler_angles` [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] represent the rotations about the X, Y, Z axes, which means there is no rotation applied for this coordinate system. 2. Drawing the 2D Sketch Next, create a new 2D sketch based on the previously established coordinate system. Now we will create a circle geometry for this cylindrical shape using the `sketch` information, specifically, the parameters provided for `face_1` and `loop_1`. Within `loop_1`, we will create a `circle_1`. - Create circle_1 Set the center position of the circle_1 to [0.1078, 0.1078] (derived from the sketch's `center` position). Set the radius of circle_1 to 0.1078 meters, obtained from the `radius` field in the `circle_1` definition. 3. Resizing the 2D Sketch Since we require a cylindrical object with the specified height, let's calculate the required scaling parameter to match the desired dimensions. The `sketch_scale` provided (0.2156) is derived from the `height` field in `description`. - Apply scale_factor Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.2156 to match the final height of the object (0.4312m, calculated as 2 x 0.2156m). 4. Transforming the 2D Sketch into a 3D Sketch Use the `translation_vector` and the `euler_angles` from the part's `coordinate_system` definition for transforming the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using rotation and translation. However, as the given `euler_angles` are all 0, no rotation is necessary. Then apply the `translation_vector` [0.0167, 0.0167, 0.3188] to the center of the sketched circle in the Z direction to position it correctly within the 3D space. 5. Extruding the 2D Sketch into a 3D Solid Finally, generate the 3D solid by extruding the 2D sketch using `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` values provided in the `extrusion` definition. Since they both equal 0, we just extrude the 2D sketch by the height specified in the scale factor, i.e., 0.4312 meters (2 x 0.2156m). Since it's a new part, we apply the `NewBodyFeatureOperation`, but this time as \"adding material\" to the overall shape.</description>",
