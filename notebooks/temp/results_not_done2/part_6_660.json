The vertices/lines for `face_1` through `face_4` are correctly represented.

This configuration means that only a positive extrusion is applied to all faces within the sketch, and no extrusion/cut occurs in the opposite direction.\\n  - This creates a significant discrepancy. The JSON's single `extrusion` block cannot properly represent the distinct \"\n  ,\"cut\"\n  ,\" extrusion for Sketch 5 (face_5) as described. For a cut, there would typically be a separate extrusion feature with a `SubtractBodyFeatureOperation` or the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` would be 0.2425 if the operation type allowed it to be a cut through an internal loop.\\n  - As the JSON stands, it would extrude all faces in the positive normal direction, completely missing the intended \"\n  ,\"cut\"\n  ,\" for Sketch 5 in the opposite direction.\\n\\n- Correction: The JSON's extrusion parameters do not correctly represent the described extrusion for Sketch 5. The `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` should be `0.2425` if it was intended for the `NewBodyFeatureOperation` to create a body extending both ways, but the description clearly indicates a *cut* for Sketch 5, which usually requires a separate operation. Therefore, the JSON is invalid as it does not correctly implement the described extrusion for Sketch 5.\\n</think>"
