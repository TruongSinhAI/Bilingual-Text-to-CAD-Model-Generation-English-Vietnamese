    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will serve as the base for the first part of the CAD model. Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the aforementioned coordinate system. The sketch should have a rectangular shape with parallel sides and right angles, with a slightly tapered shape narrowing towards the top. Step 3: Define the curves of the sketch * Define an arc (arc\\\\_1) with the following points: + Start Point: [0.0, 0.0312] + Mid Point: [0.0092, 0.0092] + End Point: [0.0312, 0.0] * Define a line (line\\\\_1) with the following points: + Start Point: [0.0312, 0.0] + End Point: [0.7188, 0.0] * Define an arc (arc\\\\_2) with the following points: + Start Point: [0.7188, 0.0] + Mid Point: [0.7408, 0.0092] + End Point: [0.75, 0.0312] * Define a line (line\\\\_2) with the following points: + Start Point: [0.75, 0.0312] + End Point: [0.75, 0.6875] * Define an arc (arc\\\\_3) with the following points: + Start Point: [0.75, 0.6875] + Mid Point: [0.7408, 0.7096] + End Point: [0.7188, 0.7188] * Define a line (line\\\\_3) with the following points: + Start Point: [0.7188, 0.7188] + End Point: [0.0312, 0.7188] * Define an arc (arc\\\\_4) with the following points: + Start Point: [0.0312, 0.7188] + Mid Point: [0.0092, 0.7096] + End Point: [0.0, 0.6875] * Define a line (line\\\\_4) with the following points: + Start Point: [0.0, 0.6875] + End Point: [0.0, 0.0312] Step 4: Close the loop of the sketch The sketch consists of one loop containing four arcs and four lines. Ensure that the loop is closed by connecting the start and end points of the sketch. The loop should have a combined length of approximately 0.75 units and a height of approximately 0.0937 units. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0937 units and in the opposite direction of normals by 0.0 units. Apply a sketch scale of 0.75 to the sketch during the extrusion process. This will create a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, narrowing towards the top, and with a slightly tapered shape. The final dimensions of this part are as follows: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.75 units * Height: 0.0937 units The first part of the CAD model is now complete. The subsequent parts will be constructed in a similar manner, building upon the previously constructed parts using the operation defined for that part. All intermediate parts combine to form the final CAD model.</description>",
