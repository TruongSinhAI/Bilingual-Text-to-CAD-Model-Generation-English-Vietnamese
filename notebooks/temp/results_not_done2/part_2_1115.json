Draw a circle with a radius of 0.1607 and a center at (0.1607, 0.1607). *Create Face 1 and Loop 2* 1. Draw a smaller circle with a radius of 0.0686 and a center at (0.1607, 0.1607). *Create Face 2 and Loop 1* 1. Draw an arc starting at (0.0, 0.1607) and ending at (0.3214, 0.1607) with a midpoint at (0.1607, 0.3214). 2. Draw a line starting at (0.3214, 0.1607) and ending at (0.3214, 0.5893). 3. Draw an arc starting at (0.3214, 0.5893) and ending at (0.0, 0.5893) with a midpoint at (0.1607, 0.4286). 4. Draw a line starting at (0.0, 0.5893) and ending at (0.0, 0.1607) to close the loop. *Create Face 3 and Loop 1* 1. Draw a circle with a radius of 0.1607 and a center at (0.1607, 0.5893). *Create Face 3 and Loop 2* 1. Draw a smaller circle with a radius of 0.0686 and a center at (0.1607, 0.5893). **Step 4: Apply Constraints** 1. Ensure that both circles are concentric. 2. Ensure that all loops are closed. 3. Ensure that the arcs follow the correct curvature. **Step 5: Apply the Scaling Parameter and Extrude** 1. Scale the 2D sketch using a factor of 0.75. 2.
