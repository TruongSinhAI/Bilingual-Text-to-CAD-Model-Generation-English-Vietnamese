However, the \\\"operation\\\" for Part 2 is \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" in the JSON, which is not explicitly stated in the provided trimmed description. While extruding opposite to the normal can often be part of a cutting operation, the description does not specify the exact boolean operation. Therefore, the description does not fully match the JSON regarding the \\\"operation\\\" field for Part 2.The JSON is accurate based on common CAD practices, but the description lacks explicit mention of the \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\". For strict matching, this is a discrepancy. Thus, the validation is 'No'.</think>"
