Ensure that the loop containing the circular holes remains closed by connecting the points in a continuous manner. Step 5: Extrude the sketch to create the 3D model Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by a distance of 0.1741 units. This will create the rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. Part 2: Construct a tapered cylindrical object Step 1: Set the coordinate system Create a new coordinate system with Euler Angles (180, 0, -90) and Translation Vector (0.7087, 0.3984, 0.0761). This will align the cylinder in the desired position slightly tilted towards the viewer. Step 2: Create the 2D sketch Create a new 2D sketch on the XY plane. This sketch represents the profile of the tapered cylinder. Step 3: Draw the circular arc on the sketch Draw a circle with center at (0.0109, 0.0109) and radius of 0.0109.
