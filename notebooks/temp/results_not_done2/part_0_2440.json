The sides are parallel, and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Step 1: Create a New Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation (euler\\\\_angles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and no translation (translation\\\\_vector = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]). Step 2: Draw the Sketch Create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Face 1 For Face 1, create a loop with four straight lines: 1. Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.6138, 0.0) 2. Line 2: Start Point (0.6138, 0.0), End Point (0.6138, 0.75) 3. Line 3: Start Point (0.6138, 0.75), End Point (0.0, 0.75) 4. Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.75), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Face 2 For Face 2, create a loop with four straight lines close to Face 1: 1. Line 1: Start Point (0.6138, 0.0), End Point (0.6205, 0.0) 2.

Line 4: Start Point (0.6138, 0.75), End Point (0.6138, 0.0) Step 3: Scale the Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Step 4: Transform the Sketch and Extrude Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the following euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0067 units and in the opposite direction by 0.0 units with a sketch scale of 0.75. This forms the final shape, a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, the dimensions of which are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units.</description>",
