Determine the dimensions of the parts: * Length: 0.7212 * Width: 0.1442 * Height: 0.7212 The first part involves creating a rectangular prism shape with a cylindrical hole on one side.

Set the sketch scale to 0.75 and the operation to \"  \n  , \"new body\",  \n  \". Part 2: Construct a long, thin rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0375. For the sketch, create a new face and add a loop with four lines: 1.

Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.02), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Extrude the sketch with a depth of 0.0 in the normal direction and a depth of 0.02 in the opposite direction.
