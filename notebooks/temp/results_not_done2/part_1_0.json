    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Cylindrical Object with a Flat Top and Bottom, and a Slightly Tapered Middle Section** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.375, 0.0). Proceed to create the sketch for this part. The sketch will be drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. **Sketch Face 1:** Create a single loop for this sketch (Loop 1). This loop consists of a single circle (Circle 1). Set the center of Circle 1 to the point (0.375, 0.375) and give it a radius of 0.375. This completes the sketch for part 1. The sketch is now ready for further processing. The next step is to define the extrusion. For this part, scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Then, extrude the scaled sketch by a depth of 0.1875 towards the normal and 0.1875 in the opposite direction of the normal, resulting in a slightly tapered middle section. This completes the instructions for part 1. Layer upon this base part to construct the entire CAD model. **Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Slanted Top and Bottom, and a Vertical Middle Section** For this part, create a new coordinate system with the following properties: Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -45.0] Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.0] Proceed by creating the sketch for part 2. **Sketch Face 1:** Create a single closed loop for this sketch (Loop 1), composed of two lines (Line 1 and Line 2). Line 1 starts at the point (0.0, 0.375) and ends at the point (0.375, 0.0). Line 2 starts at the point (0.375, 0.0) and ends at the point (0.75, 0.375). The loop remains closed since the ending point of Line 2 matches the starting point of Line 1 (0.375, 0.375). **Sketch Face 2:** Create another closed loop for this sketch (Loop 2), composed of two lines (Line 3 and Line 4) as well. Line 3 starts at (0.75, 0.375) and ends at (1.125, 0.375). Line 4 starts at (1.125, 0.375) and ends at (0.75, 0.75). Line 1's ending point, (0.375, 0.375), intersects lines 3 and 4. These faces and loops define the slanted top and bottom parts of the object, while the middle section will remain vertical to the rest of the CAD model. The next step is to define the extrusion. But before that, scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Then, extrude the scaled sketch by a depth of 0.1875 towards the normal and 0.1875 in the opposite direction of the normal. This part's extrusion results in the vertical middle section. This completes the instructions for part 2. Now stack and join the first two parts to form a cohesive CAD model. Repeat this process for any additional intermediate parts and follow up with the final shape instructions. (For brevity, the instructions for the next parts have been omitted, but follow the example provided for each additional part. Make each part sequentially, using the previously constructed parts as a base according to the CAD Assembly JSON.) **Final Shape: Cylindrical Object with a Slanted Top and Bottom, and a Vertical Middle Section** With all the necessary parts created, stack and join them in the specified order to form the final CAD shape. The final object consists of the desired number of tapered sections and slanted top and bottom parts. The subtle variations and stacking produce the desired compression effect. With each part extruded, transformed, and combined, the final cylindrical object comes to life.</description>",
