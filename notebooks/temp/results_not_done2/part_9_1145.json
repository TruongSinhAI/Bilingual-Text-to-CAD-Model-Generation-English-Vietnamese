This will help us define the correct orientation of our sketch in 3D space. With the transformed 3D sketch in place, we can now proceed with extruding the sketch into a 3D model. Set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.75 units and the extrude depth opposite the normal to 0 units, which will extrude the sketch to a specific depth and in a certain direction. Finally, we will apply the \"New Body Feature Operation\" to create a new solid body.

Set the Euler angles to [-90, 0, -90] and the translation vector to [0, 0, 0]. This will ensure that the 2D sketch plane is aligned with the cylindrical object's central axis. Now, create the 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. Draw a single circle on the sketch plane, with its center at [0.0341, 0.0341] and a radius of 0.0341. This circle defines the base of the cylindrical object. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.0682. This will ensure that the CAD model is proportionally accurate. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch, using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by a depth of 0.75 units. This will create the cylindrical object with a tapered end. The height and width of this part are both 0.0682 units, while the length is 0.75 units. **Part 2: Rectangular Prism with a Curved Side** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0, 0, -90] and the translation vector to [0, 0.0341, 0.0595]. This will ensure that the 2D sketch plane is aligned with the rectangular prism's central axis. Now, create the 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. Draw two rectangles on the sketch plane, each with four lines. The first rectangle has its opposite corners at [0, 0] and [0.1023, 0.0087]. The second rectangle has its opposite corners at [0.6477, 0] and [0.75, 0.0087].

This will create the rectangular prism with a curved side. Use a boolean operation to cut the prism from the cylindrical object created in Part 1. The resulting CAD model will be a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom, and a flat base. It has a smooth surface and appears to be made of a reflective material.
