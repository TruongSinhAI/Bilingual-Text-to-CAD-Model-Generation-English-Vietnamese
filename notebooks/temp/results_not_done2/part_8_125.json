    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [−90.0, 0.0, −90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.75, 0.1667, 0.0] Now, let's move on to creating the 2D sketch. We'll be sketching on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. Sketch Begin by creating a new sketch with the following information: * Face 1 + Loop 1 - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.1667, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.1667, 0.0], End Point [0.1667, 0.5833] - Line 3: Start Point [0.1667, 0.5833], End Point [0.0, 0.5833] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.5833], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Note that Loop 1 is a closed loop consisting of 4 lines. Extrusion Now, extrude the sketch using the following information: * Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0 * Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.75 * Sketch scale: 0.5833 * Operation: Create a new solid body (NewBodyFeatureOperation) This part has a final description as follows: * Shape: A rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.5833 * Height: 0.5833 Provide these instructions for the junior CAD designer considering the given JSON data. The designer now can use the detailed information about the curves, loops, and faces to generate an accurate CAD model. Conclusion In this example given in the JSON, we have one part (Part 1) to construct, a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. We provided instructions with clear headings, section breaks, and organized each part's instructions throughout the process. We've used ordinal numbers to denote the parts, sketches, curves, loops or faces and provided detailed instructions for creating sketches with precise curve and loop information. Finally, we've described the height, width and length of the intermediate part and final shape without any additional assumptions.</description>",
