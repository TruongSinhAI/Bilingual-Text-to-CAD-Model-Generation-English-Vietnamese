    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1 Instructions Construct a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered middle section and a cylindrical base and top. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Coordinate System Use the following euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: (-90.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) Creating the Sketch Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Within the sketch, create the following faces and loops: Face 1 Create a new loop for Face 1 (loop\\\\_1). Within loop\\\\_1, perform the following: 1. Create line\\\\_1 connecting point (0.0, 0.0) and point (0.75, 0.0) 2. Create line\\\\_2 connecting point (0.75, 0.0) and point (0.75, 0.12) 3. Create line\\\\_3 connecting point (0.75, 0.12) and point (0.565, 0.12) 4. Create line\\\\_4 connecting point (0.565, 0.12) and point (0.565, 0.25) 5. Create line\\\\_5 connecting point (0.565, 0.25) and point (0.505, 0.25) 6. Create an arc\\\\_1 from point (0.505, 0.25) towards the middle point (0.375, 0.12) and ending at point (0.245, 0.25) 7. Create line\\\\_6 connecting point (0.245, 0.25) and point (0.185, 0.25) 8. Create line\\\\_7 connecting point (0.185, 0.25) and point (0.185, 0.12) 9. Create line\\\\_8 connecting point (0.185, 0.12) and point (0.0, 0.12) 10. Create line\\\\_9 connecting point (0.0, 0.12) and point (0.0, 0.0) After creating the curves, ensure each loop is closed and loops adhere to the specified constraint rules. Extrusion Perform a 0.29 units deep extrusion in the direction of the normal vector, keeping the opposite normal extrusion depth at 0.0. Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch.
