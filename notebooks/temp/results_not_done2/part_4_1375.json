Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0875, 0.0]. Create Sketch Create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Face 1 1. Draw a circle centered at [0.375, 0.375] with a radius of 0.375. This is loop 1 of face 1. Face 2 1. Draw a hexagon with vertices at [0.2667, 0.3125], [0.375, 0.25], [0.4833, 0.3125], [0.4833, 0.4375], [0.375, 0.5], and [0.2667, 0.4375]. This is loop 1 of face 2. Scale Sketch Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. Extrude Sketch Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0.0875 towards the normal, and 0.0 in the opposite direction. Part 2 Instructions Create Coordinate System Re-use the same coordinate system from Part 1. Create Sketch Create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Face 1 1. Redraw the same hexagon as Part 1, Face 2, with vertices at [0.2667, 0.3125], [0.375, 0.25], [0.4833, 0.3125], [0.4833, 0.4375], [0.375, 0.5], and [0.2667, 0.4375]. This is loop 1 of face 1. Face 2 1. Draw a circle centered at [0.375, 0.375] with a radius of 0.075. This is loop 2 of face 2. Scale Sketch Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. Extrude Sketch Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0 in the normal direction, and 0.05 in the opposite direction.
