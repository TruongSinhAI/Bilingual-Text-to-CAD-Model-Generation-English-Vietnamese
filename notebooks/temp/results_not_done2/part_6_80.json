The description does not mention any loop_2 for Part 3's faces, and the JSON also does not have loop_2 for Part 3, so this part of the sketch is consistent.\\n  - Extrusion:\\n    - extrude_depth_towards_normal: Inferred 0.0, JSON 0.0. Matches.\\n    - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: Inferred 0.2143, JSON 0.2143. Matches.\\n    - sketch_scale: The description for Part 3 does NOT specify a sketch_scale. The JSON has 0.5771.

Matches.\\n\\n- Corrections:\\n  - For Part 2, the description should include the details for `loop_2` for both `face_1` and `face_2`.\\n  - For Part 3, the description should specify the `sketch_scale` (0.5771) for the extrusion.\\n</think>"
