In a 3-point arc, the `Mid Point` is a point *on* the arc, not its geometric center.

Correct.\\n  - Sketch: The description for both `face_1` and `face_2` (including their respective `loop_1` rectangles and `loop_2` circles with all coordinates/radii) matches the JSON exactly. Correct.\\n  - Extrusion: The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0937), `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0), and `sketch_scale` (0.75) all match the JSON. Correct.\\n  - Correction: The description states that the operation is to \\\"cut or removed from the existing body or volume\\\", which implies a \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\". However, the JSON explicitly states `\"\n        ,\"operation\"\n        ,\" : \"\n        ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n        ,\"`. This is a direct contradiction between the description and the JSON regarding the extrusion operation. If the intent is to create a new body with internal holes (which is common for a \"\n        ,\"rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole\"\n        ,\"), then \"\n        ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n        ,\" is appropriate, and the description's last sentence is misleading. But based on a strict text-to-JSON match, it's a mismatch.\\n\\n- Conclusion: The description states a cutting/removal operation, while the JSON specifies a new body creation. This fundamental difference in the operation type means the description does not fully match the JSON.\\n</think>"
