    "reasoning": "<description>**Construct the base part** The base part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system, with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. For the sketch, create a face (face\\\\_1) and a single loop (loop\\\\_1) on this face. This loop consists of 4 lines (line\\\\_1 through line\\\\_4) which form a rectangle. - line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.1111, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.1111, 0.0], End Point = [0.1111, 0.75] - line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.1111, 0.75], End Point = [0.0, 0.75] - line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.75], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Scale the sketch using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter of 0.75.
