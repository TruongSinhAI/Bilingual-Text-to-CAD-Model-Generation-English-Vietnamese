    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Instructions Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Now, let's move on to creating the sketch. 1. Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw the first line with a start point at (0.0, 0.0) and an end point at (0.6781, 0.0). 3. Draw the second line with a start point at (0.6781, 0.0) and an end point at (0.6781, 0.75). 4. Draw the third line with a start point at (0.6781, 0.75) and an end point at (0.0, 0.75). 5. Draw the fourth line with a start point at (0.0, 0.75) and an end point at (0.0, 0.0). You have now created the sketch with a single face containing four lines. Here's the detailed breakdown of the face and loops. - Face 1: - Loop 1 (closed): - Line 1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.6781, 0.0) - Line 2: (0.6781, 0.0) to (0.6781, 0.75) - Line 3: (0.6781, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75) - Line 4: (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.0) Next, let's move on to scaling and transforming the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. 1. Scale the entire 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 2. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Finally, let's extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. 1. Extrude the sketch along the z-axis (normal direction) with a depth of 0.3375 units. The final dimensions of this part will be: - Length: ~0.75 units - Width: ~0.75 units - Height: ~0.34 units Now, your part is complete. Proceed to create subsequent parts using the provided JSON or your cad designer's instructions.</description>",
