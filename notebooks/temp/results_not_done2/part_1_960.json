There are a series of concentric circles along its length, creating a pattern of ridges. The top and bottom sections are flat and parallel to each other. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. For the 2D sketch, create two circles on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The first circle is located at (0.1446, 0.1446) with a radius of 0.1446. The second circle is nested inside the first one, located at the same point with a radius of 0.0795. For the first face, create two loops. The first loop consists of one circle, and the second loop consists of another circle. For the second face, create a loop comprising of four entities - two lines and two arcs. - The first line starts at (0.146, 0) and ends at (0.611, 0.0044). - The first arc starts at (0.611, 0.0044), has a midpoint at (0.75, 0.1446), and ends at (0.611, 0.2849). - The second line starts at (0.611, 0.2849) and ends at (0.146, 0.2893). - The second arc starts at (0.146, 0.2893), has a midpoint at (0.2893, 0.1446), and ends at (0.146, 0).

Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the provided euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model, with an extrusion depth of 0.1268 towards the normal and no extrusion in the opposite direction. **Part 2: Tapered Cylindrical Object** The second part is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and a flat bottom. The top is slightly curved and the bottom is flat. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. Create a new coordinate system. For the 2D sketch, create two circles on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The first circle is located at (0.1446, 0.1446) with a radius of 0.1446. The second circle is nested inside the first one, located at the same point with a radius of 0.0795. Create a loop consisting of one circle. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.2893.
