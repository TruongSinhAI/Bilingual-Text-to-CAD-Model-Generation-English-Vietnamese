This part is created by first defining a coordinate system, then creating a 2D sketch on a plane defined by that coordinate system, and finally extruding the sketch into 3D space. The following instructions will guide you through the process. **Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.4853, 0.0] **2D Sketch** Next, create a 2D sketch on the plane defined by the new coordinate system. Within this sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and then create the following loops and curves: * Loop\\\\_1 + Line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] + Line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.2547] + Line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.75, 0.2547], End Point = [0.6903, 0.2547] + Arc\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.6903, 0.2547], End Point = [0.5411, 0.1055], Mid Point = [0.6158, 0.1801] + Arc\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.5411, 0.1055], End Point = [0.4145, 0.1055], Mid Point = [0.4778, 0.0205] + Line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.4145, 0.1055], End Point = [0.1535, 0.3666] + Arc\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.1535, 0.3666], End Point = [0.3026, 0.5158], Mid Point = [0.228, 0.4412] + Line\\\\_5: Start Point = [0.3026, 0.5158], End Point = [0.2728, 0.5456] + Arc\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.2728, 0.5456], End Point = [0.0, 0.2728], Mid Point = [0.1577, 0.4092] + Line\\\\_6: Start Point = [0.0, 0.2728], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] **Extrusion** Now that the 2D sketch is complete, it can be extruded into 3D space. Apply the following extrusion properties to the sketch: * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.4853 * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 * Sketch Scale: 0.75 * Operation: Create a new solid body (Natural language description of \"  ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"   ,\")</description><valid>No</valid><think>***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description defines a single part, \"  ,\"part_1\"  ,\".\\n\\npart_1:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from description)\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.4853, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.2547] (Derived from description)\\n----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.2547], End [0.6903, 0.2547] (Derived from description)\\n----arc_1: Start [0.6903, 0.2547], End [0.5411, 0.1055], Mid [0.6158, 0.1801] (Derived from description)\\n----arc_2: Start [0.5411, 0.1055], End [0.4145, 0.1055], Mid [0.4778, 0.0205] (Derived from description)\\n----line_4: Start [0.4145, 0.1055], End [0.1535, 0.3666] (Derived from description)\\n----arc_3: Start [0.1535, 0.3666], End [0.3026, 0.5158], Mid [0.228, 0.4412] (Derived from description)\\n----line_5: Start [0.3026, 0.5158], End [0.2728, 0.5456] (Derived from description)\\n----arc_4: Start [0.2728, 0.5456], End [0.0, 0.2728], Mid [0.1577, 0.4092] (Derived from description)\\n----line_6: Start [0.0, 0.2728], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.4853 (Derived from description)\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Derived from description)\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from description)\\n--operation: \"  ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"   ,\" (Derived from description: \"  ,\"Create a new solid body (Natural language description of \"  ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"  ,\").\"  ,\").\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check Sketch Components:\\n--The description specifies a mix of \"  ,\"Line\"   ,\" and \"  ,\"Arc\"   ,\" segments to form Loop_1.

It does not contain any \"  ,\"arc\"   ,\" objects or their corresponding \"  ,\"Mid Point\"   ,\" parameters.\\n--While the start and end points of the segments match between the description's lines/arcs and the JSON's lines, the *type* of geometric entity (arc vs. line) is fundamentally different. This indicates a significant mismatch between the description and the JSON's representation of the sketch.\\n\\n-Correction: The JSON's sketch contains only lines, whereas the description specifies a combination of lines and arcs. For a complete match, the JSON should include arc definitions with their center or mid-point parameters as described. Since it does not, the description does not match the JSON's sketch representation precisely.</think>"
