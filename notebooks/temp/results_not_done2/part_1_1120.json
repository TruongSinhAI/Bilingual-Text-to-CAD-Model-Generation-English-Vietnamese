Include the final shape's dimensions, height, width, and length to form a complete CAD model. (Note: The given Part 2 JSON does not match the provided guidelines.

Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0268, 0.0]. This will create a coordinate system where the x-axis points right, the y-axis points up, and the z-axis points into the page. The origin of the coordinate system is located slightly above the center of the page. **2. Draw the sketch** Draw a sketch on the x-y plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch should have two faces: face_1 and face_2. Face_1 should have two loops: loop_1 and loop_2. Loop_1 should have four lines: line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4. * Line_1 should start at [0.0, 0.0] and end at [0.3214, 0.0]. * Line_2 should start at [0.3214, 0.0] and end at [0.3214, 0.75]. * Line_3 should start at [0.3214, 0.75] and end at [0.0, 0.75]. * Line_4 should start at [0.0, 0.75] and end at [0.0, 0.0]. Loop_2 should have 12 lines: line_5 to line_16. The detailed end points of these lines are provided in the JSON data, but the general layout is a series of rectangular indentations along the top and bottom edges of the prism, with the longest indentation in the middle. **3. Scale the sketch** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 along the x and y axes. This will reduce the size of the prism to the desired dimensions. **4. Transform the sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Specifically, rotate the sketch by -90 degrees around the z-axis, and translate it by 0.0268 units in the positive y direction. **5. Extrude the sketch** Extrude the 3D sketch along the z-axis to create the final 3D model. The extrusion depth should be 0.0134 units in the positive z direction, and 0.0134 units in the negative z direction. This will create a prism with a thickness of 0.25 units. The resulting prism should be a curved rectangular prism with a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.0268 units, and a height of 0.75 units. The curved side of the prism is implied by the shape description in the JSON data.</description>",
