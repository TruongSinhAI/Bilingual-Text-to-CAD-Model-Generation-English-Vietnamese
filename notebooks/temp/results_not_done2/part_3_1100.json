The prism is positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the top right corner of the image. The cylindrical hole is centered along the diagonal axis of the prism. The prism has a flat bottom and a flat top. The height of the prism is approximately twice the width. The width of the prism is approximately half the height. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of approximately 50% of the width of the prism. **Step 1: Create Coordinate System** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] **Step 2: Create Sketch on Plane** Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system.

The sketch\\\\_scale should be set to 0.0526. This will create a rectangular prism. **Step 6: Create Cylindrical Hole** Create a cylindrical hole through the center of the prism along the diagonal axis. The diameter of the hole should be approximately 50% of the width of the prism. The length, width, and height of this intermediate part are as follows: - Length: 0.0526 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.0526</description>",
