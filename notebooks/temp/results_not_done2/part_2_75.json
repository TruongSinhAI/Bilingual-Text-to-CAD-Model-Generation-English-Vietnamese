This loop forms a closed shape, which represents the base of the object. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** Apply a scaling factor of 0.7193 to the entire sketch. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch** Extrude the sketch along the normal vector by a depth of 0.0123 units. This will create a 3D solid object. 5. **Finalize the CAD model** The length, width, and height of the finished CAD model for part 1 will be as follows: - Length: ~0.7193 units - Width: ~0.0123 units - Height: ~0.7193 units Save this part and prepare for the next step in the CAD assembly.</description>",
