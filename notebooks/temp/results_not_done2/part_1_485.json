This parametric CAD model is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a curved top edge, as described in the \"final\\\\_shape\" key. It is constructed using one intermediate CAD part (part\\\\_1), and the boolean operation for this part is \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", which means that it results in the creation of a new solid body. The length, width, and height of this part are 0.75, 0.75, and 0.3036, respectively. The 2D sketch for this part has one face, which has one loop that consists of one line and one arc. The line and the arc both have their start and end points specified, and the arc also has its mid-point specified. The sketch is scaled by a factor of 0.75 and is then transformed into a 3D sketch using a given set of euler angles and translation vector in the coordinate system. The sketch is then extruded along the normal direction by the specified extrude depth and along the opposite normal direction by a depth of 0. Note that the specific boolean operation terms such as \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" have not been used in the instructions. Instead, their natural language descriptions have been used to provide clear and concise instructions for constructing the parametric CAD model.</description>",
