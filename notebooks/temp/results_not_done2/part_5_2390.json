    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A long, thin, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end First, draw a circle on a new coordinate system. The circle's center should be at (0.0086, 0.0086) and its radius should be 0.0086. This circle forms the base of the cylindrical part. Next, create a 3D sketch using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. Extrude the sketch by 0.75 units along the normal direction. The scaling parameter for the sketch is 0.0171. This results in a long, thin, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end. Part 2: A three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Begin by creating a new coordinate system using the euler angles [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector [0.0789, 0.3214, 0.0121]. On this coordinate system, draw a rectangle with four straight lines: 1. Line 1: Start point (0.0, 0.0), end point (0.1071, 0.0) 2. Line 2: Start point (0.1071, 0.0), end point (0.1071, 0.0054) 3.

Now, create a 3D sketch with the same coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch in the opposite direction of the normal by 0.0943 units. Set the sketch scale to 0.1071. This results in a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Perform a cut operation using this prism to subtract from the previous CAD model. Part 3: Two cylinders, one larger than the other, positioned diagonally from each other Create a new coordinate system using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector [0.0057, 0.3504, 0.0121]. On this coordinate system, draw two overlapping circles: 1. Circle 1: Center at (0.0032, 0.0032), radius of 0.0032. 2. Circle 2: Center at (0.0032, 0.0461), radius of 0.0032. These two circles represent two cylinders on this coordinate system. Now, create a 3D sketch with the same coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch in the opposite direction of the normal by 0.0161 units. Set the sketch scale to 0.0493. Perform a cut operation using this object to subtract from the previous CAD model.

    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: A long, thin, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end First, draw a circle on a new coordinate system. The circle's center should be at (0.0086, 0.0086) and its radius should be 0.0086. This circle forms the base of the cylindrical part. Next, create a 3D sketch using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. Extrude the sketch by 0.75 units along the normal direction. The scaling parameter for the sketch is 0.0171. Part 2: A three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Begin by creating a new coordinate system using the euler angles [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector [0.0789, 0.3214, 0.0121]. On this coordinate system, draw a rectangle with four straight lines: 1. Line 1: Start point (0.0, 0.0), end point (0.1071, 0.0) 2. Line 2: Start point (0.1071, 0.0), end point (0.1071, 0.0054) 3. Line 3: Start point (0.1071, 0.0054), end point (0.0, 0.0054) 4. Line 4: Start point (0.0, 0.0054), end point (0.0, 0.0) This closed loop forms the base rectangle with a height of 0.0054 units. Now, create a 3D sketch with the same coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch in the opposite direction of the normal by 0.0943 units. Set the sketch scale to 0.1071. Perform a cut operation using this prism to subtract from the previous CAD model. Part 3: Two cylinders, one larger than the other, positioned diagonally from each other Create a new coordinate system using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector [0.0057, 0.3504, 0.0121]. On this coordinate system, draw two overlapping circles: 1. Circle 1: Center at (0.0032, 0.0032), radius of 0.0032. 2. Circle 2: Center at (0.0032, 0.0461), radius of 0.0032. Now, create a 3D sketch with the same coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch in the opposite direction of the normal by 0.0161 units. Set the sketch scale to 0.0493.
