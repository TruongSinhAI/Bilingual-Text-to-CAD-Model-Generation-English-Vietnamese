Perform a boolean cut operation with the extrusion depth of 0.0262 in the opposite direction of normals. Part 3: Creating a custom rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom The process for this part is identical to Part 2, except for the extrusion depth. Perform the same steps as Part 2, but with the following changes to the \"extrusion\" component: - Change the \"extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal\" to 0.0375.

    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Creating a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered shape 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the Translation Vector to (0.0, 0.0375, 0.0). 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the created coordinate system. 3. Create a circle on the sketch plane using the center point (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. This forms face_1 of the part. 4. Close the loop and complete the sketch. 5. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 6. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 7. Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model with a depth of 0.0375 towards the normal and no extrusion in the opposite direction. Part 2: Creating a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the Translation Vector to (0.2252, 0.0375, 0.172). 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the created coordinate system. 3. Create nine lines forming a closed loop as follows: - Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.3473), End Point (0.0051, 0.0585) - Line 2: Start Point (0.0051, 0.0585), End Point (0.0635, 0.0) - Line 3: Start Point (0.0635, 0.0), End Point (0.2356, 0.0) - Line 4: Start Point (0.2356, 0.0), End Point (0.2942, 0.0585) - Line 5: Start Point (0.2942, 0.0585), End Point (0.2942, 0.3473) - Line 6: Start Point (0.2942, 0.3473), End Point (0.236, 0.4124) - Line 7: Start Point (0.236, 0.4124), End Point (0.1498, 0.4124) - Line 8: Start Point (0.1498, 0.4124), End Point (0.0635, 0.4124) - Line 9: Start Point (0.0635, 0.4124), End Point (0.0, 0.3473) This forms loop_1 of the part. 4. Close the loop and complete the sketch. 5. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.4124. 6. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 7. Perform a boolean cut operation with the extrusion depth of 0.0262 in the opposite direction of normals. Part 3: Creating a custom rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom The process for this part is identical to Part 2, except for the extrusion depth. Perform the same steps as Part 2, but with the following changes to the \"\n  ,\"extrusion\",\n  \" component: - Change the \",\n  \"extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal\",\n  \" to 0.0375.</description>\\n<valid>No</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: Three parts are described: \\\"Part 1: Creating a cylindrical object\\\", \\\"Part 2: Creating a rectangular prism\\\", and \\\"Part 3: Creating a custom rectangular prism\\\".
