The prism's height is extruded along the normal direction by 0.025 units and 0 units in the opposite direction. The sketch is scaled by a factor of 0.75. Completing the Assembly: After generating the first part, proceed with creating subsequent parts as required: * **For each new part:** 1. Create a new coordinate system with specified Euler angles and a translation vector, followed by creating a 2D sketch. 2. Draw curves and loops for each face in order to generate multiple faces as required. 3. Scale the 2D sketch using the given `sketch_scale` scaling factor. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using euler angles and translation vector. 5. Extrude the 3D model with the provided extrusion depth towards and opposite to the normal. 6. Describe the newly created part in the `description` section, including the shape, length, width, and height. 7. Define the operation between the new part and the preceding CAD models using natural language descriptions instead of boolean operation terms. In the end, all parts should be combined to form the final CAD model as described in the `final_shape` field.</description>",
