However, the JSON specifies `\\\"operation\\\":\\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\"`. Similar to Part 1, these are different operations and represent a mismatch.\\n\\n- Result: The description does not fully match the JSON due to missing `face_2` details for both Part 1 and Part 2, and inconsistent operation types for both parts.
