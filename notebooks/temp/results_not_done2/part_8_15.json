Draw line 4 from [0.1973, 0.4202] to [0.0497, 0.3968]. 7. Draw arc 2 with a center point at [0.0324, 0.3871], a start point at [0.0497, 0.3968], and an endpoint at [0.0255, 0.3685]. 8. Draw line 5 from [0.0255, 0.3685] to [0.0255, 0.225]. 9. Draw line 6 from [0.0255, 0.225] to [0.0255, 0.0815]. 10. Draw arc 3 with a center point at [0.0324, 0.0629], a start point at [0.0255, 0.0815], and an endpoint at [0.0497, 0.0532]. 11. Draw line 7 from [0.0497, 0.0532] to [0.1973, 0.0298]. 12. Draw arc 4 with a center point at [0.21, 0.0138], a start point at [0.1973, 0.0298], and an endpoint at [0.195, 0.0]. 13. Draw line 8 from [0.195, 0.0] back to [0.0, 0.0], closing the loop. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.45. Step 4: Extrude the sketch into a 3D model Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal direction by 0.75 units to create the final solid body for part 1.</description>",
