    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Sloped Side The first part of the assembly is a rectangular prism with a sloped side. The prism has a length of 0.4188 units, a width of 0.4188 units, and a height of 0.3701 units. The sloped side is at a 45-degree angle. Creating the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system for this part. The euler angles should be set to 0 degrees for all axes, and the translation vector should be set to [0, 0, 0]. Creating the Sketch Now, create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 1. Draw a line from point [0, 0] to point [0.0487, 0]. 2. Draw a line from point [0.0487, 0] to point [0.0487, 0.0974]. 3. Draw a line from point [0.0487, 0.0974] to point [0.0487, 0.1948]. 4. Draw a line from point [0.0487, 0.1948] to point [0.0487, 0.4188]. 5. Draw a line from point [0.0487, 0.4188] to point [0, 0.4188]. 6. Close the loop by drawing a line from point [0, 0.4188] back to point [0, 0]. Scaling the Sketch After creating the sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.4188. Transforming the Sketch into a 3D Sketch Next, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: [0, 0, 45] * Translation Vector: [0, 0, 0] Extruding the Sketch Finally, extrude the 3D sketch along the Z-axis by a distance of 0.3701 units. This will create the rectangular prism with a sloped side. Conclusion By following these instructions, the junior CAD designer should be able to create the first part of the assembly, which is a rectangular prism with a sloped side. This part is crucial for the overall assembly, as it sets the foundation for the other parts. The next steps will involve adding more parts to the assembly, following a similar process of creating a coordinate system, sketch, scaling, transforming, and extruding.</description>",
