Draw a polyline with 8 line segments (line\\\\_1 to line\\\\_8) as specified below: - line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.3214] - line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.75, 0.3214], End Point = [0.5357, 0.3214] - line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.5357, 0.3214], End Point = [0.5357, 0.5298] - line\\\\_5: Start Point = [0.5357, 0.5298], End Point = [0.2143, 0.5298] - line\\\\_6: Start Point = [0.2143, 0.5298], End Point = [0.2143, 0.3214] - line\\\\_7: Start Point = [0.2143, 0.3214], End Point = [0.0, 0.3214] - line\\\\_8: Start Point = [0.0, 0.3214], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] **Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch to 3D** 3.1. Apply a 3D rotation according to the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] on the 2D sketch plane. 3.2. Apply the translation vector [0.0, 0.3214, 0.0] to the 2D sketch plane. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** 4.1. Set the extrude depth towards the normal [0.3214] to create the final 3D shape. 4.2. Set the extrude depth in the opposite direction of the normal [0.0]. 4.3. Apply the sketch\\\\_scale [0.75] to the sketch. 4.4.
