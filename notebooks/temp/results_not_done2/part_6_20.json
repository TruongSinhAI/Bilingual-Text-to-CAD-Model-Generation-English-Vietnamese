Extrusion Extrude the sketch in the direction of the normal by 0.75 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.2055 before extrusion. This operation results in the creation of a new solid body. Dimensions The height of the part is 0.2055 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the length is also 0.2055 units.</description>",
