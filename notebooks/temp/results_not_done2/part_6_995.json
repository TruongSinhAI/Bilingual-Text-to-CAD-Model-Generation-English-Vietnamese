Draw the first face, which is a circle. Set the center point at [0.1193, 0.1193] and specify a radius of 0.1193 units. This will create loop 1 in face 1. Next, draw the second face. This is another circle, with its center point at [0.1193, 0.1193] and a radius of 0.0562 units. This will create loop 2 in face 1. **3D Model Instructions** Scale the 2D sketch of part 1 using a scaling parameter of 0.2386. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translation vector (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model, with an extrusion depth of 0.75 units towards the normal. The operation for part 1 is a 'New Body' operation. **Dimensions and Description** The final shape of part 1 is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. The height of the cylinder is approximately three times its diameter, and the top and bottom are flat. The part's length is 0.2386 units, the width is also 0.2386 units, and the height is 0.75 units. **Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Tapered Top and Bottom** **2D Sketch Instructions** Since part 2 has the same shape as part 1, the 2D sketch instructions are identical. Create a new coordinate system for part 2. Draw the first face, a circle, with its center at [0.1193, 0.1193] and a radius of 0.1193 units. This will create loop 1 in face 1. Draw the second face, another circle, with its center at [0.1193, 0.1193] and a radius of 0.0562 units. This will create loop 2 in face 1. **3D Model Instructions** Scale the 2D sketch of part 2 using a scaling parameter of 0.2386. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translation vector (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model, with an extrusion depth of 0.4091 units towards the normal. The operation for part 2 is a 'New Body' operation. **Dimensions and Description** The final shape of part 2 is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom like part 1, but with a height of 0.4091 units. The part's length and width are the same as part 1: 0.2386 units. Please note that for simplicity, I repeated the instructions for the 2D sketch since the shape of parts 1 and 2 are identical. However, in real-world scenarios, the designer can reuse the sketch and adjust the scaling parameters or coordinate system to obtain different shapes if needed.</description>",
