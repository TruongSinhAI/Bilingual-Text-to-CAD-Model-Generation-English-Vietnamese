Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler Angles as [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector as [0.0, 0.2068, 0.0]. Next, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of two faces, each defined by a single closed loop. Face 1: The loop on this face consists of 4 lines, arranged in a rectangle. Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0]; End Point = [0.3136, 0.0] Line 2: Start Point = [0.3136, 0.0]; End Point = [0.3136, 0.1955] Line 3: Start Point = [0.3136, 0.1955]; End Point = [0.0, 0.1955] Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.1955]; End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Face 2: The loop on this face consists of 4 lines, arranged in a rectangle.

Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to a depth of 0.2068 m to create the 3D model. This completes the instructions for creating the base rectangular prism.
