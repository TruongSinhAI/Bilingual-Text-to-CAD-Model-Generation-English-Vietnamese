    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side The first part of the assembly is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The prism has dimensions of 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.0625, 0.0]. This will position and orient the prism correctly. 1. **Create the base sketch on face_1:** Start by drawing a rectangle. It should have two lines, one horizontal line with start point [0.0, 0.0] and end point [0.75, 0.0], and one vertical line with start point [0.75, 0.0] and end point [0.75, 0.5]. This forms the flat top and bottom of the prism. Close the loop by adding a line from [0.75, 0.5] to [0.0, 0.5]. This completes the rectangle perimeter. Add a curve to the sketch by drawing an arc with start point [0.0, 0.5], end point [0.75, 0.5], and a mid point at [0.375, 0.625]. This gives the prism its curved side. Note that the sketch contains multiple faces, as the original rectangle and the curved portion are separate faces. The curved portion consists of a single loop, while the rectangle consists of two loops (outer and inner) separated by the vertical line at [0.75, 0.0]. 2. **Extrude the sketch:** To create the 3D solid from the 2D sketch, set the extrude depth towards normal to 0.0625 and the sketch scale to 0.75. Extrude to create a 3D model. 这将是第一部分的构建过程。在以下部分中，我们将继续遵循相同的格式来构建剩余的部件。记住总是在“构造形状”语句后面使用详细的步骤说明。在你开始下一个部件之前，确保你已经在CAD软件中完成了这些步骤，并且你已经得到了第一个部件。</description>",

Since the sketch was drawn on the X-Y plane, the extrusion will also be parallel to the Z-axis. We want the material to be removed at the opposite direction of the normal, so set the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` to 0.0 and the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` to 0.25. The scaling factor `sketch_scale` should be set to 0.75. Result After the `NewBodyFeatureOperation`, you will have created the first part of the CAD model.

    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: 3D model of a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top Coordinate system Create a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.25, 0.0). This will position and orient the sketch plane for the first part. Sketch Create the sketch on the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system. Our sketch consists of a single face, divided into seven connected lines forming a closed loop. Below are the detailed specifications for each line segment in the loop. 1. First line: * Start point: (0.0, 0.0) * End point: (0.75, 0.0) 2. Second line: * Start point: (0.75, 0.0) * End point: (0.75, 0.125) 3. Third line: * Start point: (0.75, 0.125) * End point: (0.25, 0.125) 4.

Seventh line: * Start point: (0.0, 0.3397) * End point: (0.0, 0.0) Extrusion Extrude the sketch along its normal by a distance of 0.25 units. Since the sketch was drawn on the X-Y plane, the extrusion will also be parallel to the Z-axis. We want the material to be removed at the opposite direction of the normal, so set the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` to 0.0 and the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` to 0.25.
