    "reasoning": "<description>**Part 1** Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0031, 0.0, 0.6111] Next, create a sketch on face_1 of the coordinate system. Draw the following curves on the sketch, forming loop_1: - line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.7469, 0.0] - line_2: Start Point [0.7469, 0.0], End Point [0.7469, 0.7469] - line_3: Start Point [0.7469, 0.7469], End Point [0.0, 0.7469] - line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.7469], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Make sure each loop is closed, and no loops consist of a line and a circle or an arc and a circle. Each face can contain multiple loops, and every loop can contain multiple lines and arcs satisfying these constraints. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.7469. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following properties: - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0679 - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 - sketch_scale: 0.7469 This operation results in the creation of a new solid body. **Part 2** Construct a set of nine rectangular prisms with a flat top and bottom, arranged in various formations and orientations. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 180.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0045, 0.7455, 0.6111] Next, create a sketch on face_1 of the coordinate system with the following curves: - line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0706, 0.0] - line_2: Start Point [0.0706, 0.0], End Point [0.0706, 0.0706] - line_3: Start Point [0.0706, 0.0706], End Point [0.0, 0.0706] - line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0706], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Repeat the previous process to create additional loops on faces_2, 3, and 4 with similar lines. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.7442. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system.
