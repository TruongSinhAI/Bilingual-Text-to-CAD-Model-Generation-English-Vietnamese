Extruding the Sketch Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis with an extrusion depth of 0.0103 towards the positive normal direction and 0 in the opposite direction. The scaling parameter for the sketch should be set to 0.75. The resulting part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom and a slightly tapered middle section.

Drawing the Sketch Now, create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 1. Draw line 1 from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.0, 0.3103). 2. Draw line 2 from the point (0.0, 0.3103) to the point (0.0, 0.3621). 3. Draw line 3 from the point (0.0, 0.3621) to the point (0.1293, 0.3621). 4. Draw line 4 from the point (0.1293, 0.3621) to the point (0.1293, 0.3103). 5. Draw line 5 from the point (0.1293, 0.3103) to the point (0.75, 0.3103). 6.
