Save and move to the next part for further instructions. **Dimensions:** - Width: 0.1875 - Length: 0.75 - Height: 0.75 **Intermediate Parts Instructions** For each intermediate part, repeat the following steps: 1. Construct a new coordinate system by applying a rotation defined by its Euler Angles and translation defined by its Translation Vector. 2. Create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. 3. Sketch the contour using various combinations of lines, arcs, and circles, subject to the constraints below. * A Loop is always closed. * A loop can consist of multiple lines and/or arcs. * A loop can not consist of a line and a circle. * A loop can not consist of an arc and a circle. 4. Scale the 2D sketch using the sketch_scale scaling parameter. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch to a 3D sketch by applying the specified rotation defined by its euler\\\\_angles and translation defined by its translation\\\\_vector from the coordinate system. 6. Execute the specified operation (JoinFeatureOperation, CutFeatureOperation, IntersectFeatureOperation, or NewBodyFeatureOperation) to combine the resulting shape with previously constructed shapes. Use the extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal, extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal, and sketch\\\\_scale parameters to achieve the desired shape. **Final Shape Instructions** For the final shape, follow the same procedure as for the intermediate parts. However, no subsequent parts will be added to it. Use the euler angles, translation vector, 2D sketch, scaling parameter, and extrusion parameters specified in the CAD Assembly JSON. After completing the instructions for each part, the precise 3D parametric CAD model that corresponds to the original description will have been constructed.</description>",
