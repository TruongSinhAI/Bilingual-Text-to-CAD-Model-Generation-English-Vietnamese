Create a new coordinate system using the provided Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector (0.1364, 0.0, 0.2727). 2. Draw the base face on the XY plane with the following vertices: A(0, 0), B(0.4091, 0), C(0.4091, 0.4091), D(0, 0.4091). Adding curves to the base plane 3. Create a line from vertex A to vertex B. 4.

Create a closed loop as follows: connect vertex A to vertex B; vertex B to vertex C; vertex C to vertex D; and vertex D to vertex A. Creating the second loop 8. Draw a circle centered around (0.4091, 0.2045) with a radius of 0.0682. Scaling 9. Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.6136. Extrusion 10. Extrude the base plane along the negative Z-axis by a distance of 0.1364, and along the positive Z-axis by a distance of 0.0. Part 2: Rectangular Prism The second part is a rectangular prism. Sketching the base plane 11. Create a new coordinate system using the provided Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector (0.0, 0.0, 0.2727). 12. Draw the base face on the XY plane with the following vertices: A(0, 0), B(0.1364, 0), C(0.1364, 0.4091), D(0, 0.4091). Adding curves to the base plane 13.

Final Shape The final shape is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole cut through its center. This object is a combination of the two parts described above. The hole's diameter is approximately 0.5 units, as determined by the 'part_1' cylindrical hole's radius. To achieve the final shape, use the 'JoinFeatureOperation' to combine Parts 1 and 2, allowing the cylindrical hole to cut through the prism. Shape A 3D model of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat top and bottom, and the cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of approximately 0.5 units. Length The total length of the final shape is determined by the longest axis, which in this case is the rectangular prism's length (2 * 0.4091 = 0.8182 units). Width The width of the final shape is determined by the y-axis, which is the same as Part 2's width (1 * 0.4091 = 0.4091 units). Height The height of the final shape is determined by the smallest dimension, which is equal to Part 1's extrusion distance along the positive Z-axis (0.1364 units).</description>",
