The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1) with a loop (loop\\\\_1). **Step 3: Define the Loop** The loop is defined as follows: - line\\\\_1: Starting at (0.0, 0.0) and ending at (0.75, 0.0) - line\\\\_2: Starting at (0.75, 0.0) and ending at (0.75, 0.3125) - line\\\\_3: Starting at (0.75, 0.3125) and ending at (0.4006, 0.3125) - arc\\\\_1: Starting at (0.4006, 0.3125), midpoint at (0.3636, 0.2756), and ending at (0.3267, 0.3125) - line\\\\_4: Starting at (0.3267, 0.3125) and ending at (0.0, 0.3125) - line\\\\_5: Starting at (0.0, 0.3125) and ending at (0.0, 0.0) **Step 4: Scale the Sketch** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 5: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.0284 units and in the opposite normal direction by 0 units. The sketch scale for this extrusion is 0.75. The operation to be performed is a \"New Body Feature Operation\". **Additional Information** - Shape: A rectangular prism with a slightly tapered shape, narrowing slightly towards the top. - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.0284 - Height: 0.75</description>",
