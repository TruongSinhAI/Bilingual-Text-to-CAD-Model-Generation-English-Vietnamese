The model is centered and isolated against a white background. 1.1 Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees, which means there's 0.0 degree rotation around the X and Y axes, and -90.0 degree rotation around the Z axis. * Set the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.0205, 0.0], which means the 2D sketch plane is translated along the Y-axis by 0.0205 units. 1.2 Generate a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. This sketch consists of a single face (face_1), and its loops and curves. 1.3 Draw the first face, face_1, as follows: * Draw the first line, line_1, which starts at [0.0, 0.0] and ends at [0.75, 0.0]. * Draw the second line, line_2, which starts at [0.75, 0.0] and ends at [0.75, 0.1364]. * Draw the third line, line_3, which starts at [0.75, 0.1364] and ends at [0.0, 0.1364]. * Draw the fourth line, line_4, which starts at [0.0, 0.1364] and ends at [0.0, 0.0]. 1.4 The first face contains one loop, loop_1, that combines the lines in the following sequence: line_1, line_2, line_3, line_4. 1.5 Given the flat surface of the prism, there are no additional assumptions for curves. 1.6 Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 (sketch_scale) and transform it into a 3D sketch using the provided coordinate system, euler angles, and translation vector. 1.7 Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to create the 3D model: * Extrude toward the normal by a depth of 0.0102 units. * Extrude in the opposite direction of the normal by a depth of 0.0102 units. 1.8 For this part, label the dimensions of the rectangular prism as provided in the description: * The length should be 0.75 units. * The width should be 0.0205 units. * The height should also be 0.75 units.

Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal vector by 0.6806 meters, creating the desired long, thin, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end. **Part 2: A cylindrical object with a tapered end, resembling a metallic tube.** Create a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of (0.0031, 0.0031, 0.7275). Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. Draw a single circle centered at (0.0038, 0.0038) with a radius of 0.0038 meters. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.0075. Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal vector by 0.0225 meters, joining this part with any preceding parts to create a cylindrical object with a tapered end that resembles a metallic tube. **Part 3: A cylindrical object with a tapered end, resembling a metallic tube.** Create a new coordinate system with the Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 180.0) and a translation vector of (0.0031, 0.0106, 0.0469). Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. Draw a single circle centered at (0.0038, 0.0038) with a radius of 0.0038 meters. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.0075. Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal vector by 0.0469 meters, joining this part with any preceding parts to create a cylindrical object with a tapered end that resembles a metallic tube. With these instructions, the junior CAD designer can now generate parametric CAD models for each part as well as the final assembly. Each part consists of sketches with a specified number of circles, and they are combined with the help of boolean operations such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation' and 'JoinFeatureOperation'. The parts are described using the height, width, and length provided in the JSON, along with their natural language descriptions.</description>",
