Sketch Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw four circles for the four faces of the cube: 1. Face 1: Center = [0.1154, 0.1154], Radius = 0.1154 2. Face 2: Center = [0.1154, 0.4927], Radius = 0.1154 3. Face 3: Center = [0.4927, 0.1154], Radius = 0.1154 4. Face 4: Center = [0.4927, 0.4927], Radius = 0.1154 Extrusion Extrude each circle along the Z-axis (normal direction) with a depth of 0.08. This will create four cylindrical holes in the prism.

However, the JSON explicitly specifies \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\". A 'Join' operation would add material, not create holes. This is a logical inconsistency between the implied function in the description and the explicit operation in the JSON.\\n\\n-Correction: The operation for Part 2 should logically be \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" to create holes as described, but the JSON shows \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\". This is a mismatch. If the JSON is authoritative, then the description's statement \\\"This will create four cylindrical holes\\\" is misleading if the operation is \\\"Join\\\". For the purpose of matching the *JSON*, the operation should be \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" if we strictly follow the JSON. However, the reasoning step requires us to *infer* based on the description's intent. Since the description explicitly states \\\"create four cylindrical holes\\\", the inferred operation is \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\". This differs from the JSON's \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\". Therefore, there's a discrepancy in the 'operation' field for 'part_2'.\\n</think>"
