Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0, 0, 0 and a translation vector of 0, 0, 0. Next, draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Start with a line segment from 0, 0 to 0.375, 0. Then, draw a line segment from 0.375, 0 to 0.375, 0.75. Follow this with a line segment from 0.375, 0.75 to 0, 0.75. For the next line segment, use a start point of 0, 0.75 and an end point of 0, 0.6407. Now, draw a line segment from 0, 0.6407 to 0.2679, 0.6407. Then, create an arc with a start point of 0.2679, 0.6407, a mid point of 0.283, 0.6344, and an end point of 0.2893, 0.6193. This will form the curved top edge of the prism.

Follow this with a line segment from 0.2679, 0.1093 to 0, 0.1093, and another line segment from 0, 0.1093 to 0, 0. The sketch is now complete. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system (euler angles of 0, 0, 0 and translation vector of 0, 0, 0). Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.012 and the depth opposite the normal is 0. These settings will create a slight protrusion on the top edge of the prism.

Create four circles with the given center points and radii. The first circle has a center at 0.0016, 0.0016 and a radius of 0.0016. Repeat this process for the second circle, using a center at 0.0561, 0.0016, and the third circle using a center at 0.1105, 0.0016, and the fourth circle using a center at 0.1649, 0.0016. The sketch is now complete. Since the part is symmetrical, no scaling is required. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system (euler angles of 90, 0, -90 and translation vector of 0.2893, 0.4583, 0.0039). Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0 and the depth opposite the normal is 0.0171.

The model has a curved top edge and three holes aligned vertically along its central axis.</description>",
