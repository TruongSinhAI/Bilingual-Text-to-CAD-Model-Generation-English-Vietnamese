    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Cylindrical Object with a Tapered Top and Bottom Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to `(0.0, 0.0, -90.0)` and the translation vector to `(0.0, 0.375, 0.0)`. Step 2: Create Sketch for part_1 In the newly created coordinate system, create a sketch on the XY plane. This sketch will consist of two circles. Step 3: Create first circle for face_1 Create the first circle with its center at `(0.1302, 0.1302)` and radius of `0.1302`. This circle is the larger circle for the face_1 and will be referred to as circle_1 for loop_1. Step 4: Create second circle for face_1 Create the second circle with its center at `(0.1302, 0.1302)` and radius of `0.0868`. This circle is the smaller circle for the face_1 and will be referred to as circle_1 for loop_2. The final sketch will have two faces, face_1 and face_2, where each face is a closed loop of one circle. The height of the intermediate part_1 is determined by the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value, given as 0.1875 units, and the same would be the height for face_1 and face_2. The width is given as 0.375 units, the same for both faces considering width along the X-axis and the length is also provided as 0.2604 units along the X-axis. The final shape formed by this part is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom having a smooth surface that appears to be a solid, three-dimensional shape which is symmetrical along its central axis. Observation Based on the given JSON data, I have created a detailed step by step parametric CAD model instructions for an individual part. Although the JSON data contains only a single part information, I am assuming this to be one of the parts of a larger assembly. Providing the instructions in this manner ensures easy adaptation for that purpose. In case there are more parts in the assembly, I would number those parts and continue the same format as described above. The instructions provided above are based on the given JSON data and do not contain any additional assumptions.</description>",
