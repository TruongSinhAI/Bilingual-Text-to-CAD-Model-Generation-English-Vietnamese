Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. 1.1. For the first sketch, create a new face and draw the following: - Loop 1: Draw a circle with a center at [0.375, 0.375] and a radius of 0.375. - Loop 2: Draw a circle with a center at [0.375, 0.375] and a radius of 0.1023, concentric to Loop 1. 1.2. For the extrusion process, use a sketch scale of 0.75, extrude \"towards the normal\" by 0.3409 and \"opposite the normal\" by 0.0. The shape should look like a cylindrical object with a central hole, with a slightly tapered appearance from top to bottom. Part 2: Removing a Rectangular Prism from the Base Remove a rectangular prism from the base of the cylindrical object.
