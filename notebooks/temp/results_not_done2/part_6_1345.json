Create six lines with the following start and end points: * Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.5, 0.0] * Line 2: [0.5, 0.0] to [0.5, 0.625] * Line 3: [0.5, 0.625] to [0.25, 0.625] * Line 4: [0.25, 0.625] to [0.25, 0.25] * Line 5: [0.25, 0.25] to [0.0, 0.25] * Line 6: [0.0, 0.25] to [0.0, 0.0] Close the loop to create a face, and apply the sketch_scale parameter of 0.625 to the sketch. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system parameters and extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.75 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal, while setting the sketch_scale to 0.625. Then, perform a boolean operation of \"                     \n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"                     \n    ,\" to combine this part with any previous parts.

Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system parameters and perform a boolean operation of \"                     \n    ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"                     \n    ,\" with an extrusion of 0.125 opposite the normal, while setting the sketch_scale to 0.25.
