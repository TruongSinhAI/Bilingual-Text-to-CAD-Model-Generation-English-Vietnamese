Extrude the sketch by 0.1453 units towards the normal, resulting in a 3D model of the rectangular prism. Part 2: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and dimensions equal to half the length of the sides. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0, 0, 0 and a translation vector of 0.2287, 0.0723, 0. Create a sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system.
