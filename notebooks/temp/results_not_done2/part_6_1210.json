The total length of this shape is approximately 0.75 units, width is around 0.375 units, and the height is also 0.375 units. **Step 4: Transform the Sketch** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. **Step 5: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch along its normal direction by a depth of 0.375 units. Since this is `NewBodyFeatureOperation`, it will create a new solid body. This concludes creating the first part of the CAD model: a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top edge. The overall dimensions of this part are roughly 0.75 units in length, 0.375 units in width, and 0.75 units in height.</description>",
