The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. **Step 1: Draw the 2D Sketch** Create a new coordinate system with zero euler angles and zero translation vector. Within the coordinate system, draw a 2D sketch on the XY-plane. This sketch contains a single face, face 1, which is a rectangle. Face 1 (0, 0) is defined with four linear edges connecting as follows: 1. Line 1: (0, 0) to (0.75, 0) 2. Line 2: (0.75, 0) to (0.75, 0.5) 3. Line 3: (0.75, 0.5) to (0, 0.5) 4. Line 4: (0, 0.5) to (0, 0) **Step 2: Scale the Sketch** Apply a sketch_scale of 0.75 to the 2D sketch. **Step 3: Transform the Scaled Sketch into 3D** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using an euler angle rotation of (0, 0, 0) degrees and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0). **Step 4: Extrude the Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the z-axis with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.5 and a sketch scale of 0.75. This will result in the creation of the rectangular prism shape. Part 2: Construction of a Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. **Step 1: Draw the 2D Sketch** Create a new coordinate system with an euler angle rotation of (90, 0, -90) degrees and a translation vector of (0, 0.5, 0.125). Within the coordinate system, draw a 2D sketch on the YZ-plane, rotated 90 degrees from the previous sketch. This sketch contains a single face, face 1, which is a rectangle. Face 1 (0, 0) is defined with four linear edges connecting as follows: 1. Line 1: (0, 0.25) to (0.5, 0) 2. Line 2: (0.5, 0) to (0.5, 0.375) 3. Line 3: (0.5, 0.375) to (0, 0.375) 4. Line 4: (0, 0.375) to (0, 0.25) **Step 2: Scale the Sketch** Apply a sketch_scale of 0.5 to the 2D sketch. **Step 3: Transform the Scaled Sketch into 3D** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using an euler angle rotation of (0, 0, 0) degrees and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0). **Step 4: Extrude the Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the negative x-axis with an extrusion depth towards the opposite normal of 0.625 and a sketch scale of 0.5. Apply a cut operation to the original rectangular prism for this new 3D model. This results in a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top.
