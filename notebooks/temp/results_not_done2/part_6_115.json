    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1 Instructions** **Shape:** A rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. The euler angles for this coordinate system are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0484, 0.0]. Create the first face of the sketch. This face is a rectangle and is defined by the following line segments: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.2687, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.2687, 0.0], End Point [0.2687, 0.1935] - Line 3: Start Point [0.2687, 0.1935], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Create the second face of the sketch, which is also a rectangle. It shares an edge with the first face and is defined by the following line segments: - Line 1: Start Point [0.2687, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.1935] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.1935], End Point [0.2687, 0.1935] - Line 4: Start Point [0.2687, 0.1935], End Point [0.2687, 0.0] The sketch is now complete. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75, then transform it into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal direction is 0.0484 units and there is no extrusion in the opposite direction. The sketch scaling factor should be set to 0.75. The resulting part is a new solid body with the given dimensions. The length of this intermediate part is approximately 0.75 units, the width is approximately 0.048 units, and the height is the same as the extrusion depth, which is 0.0484 units. Repeat the above steps for subsequent parts, following the information provided in the CAD Assembly JSON. Remember to always begin by describing the shape being constructed and providing clear and concise step-by-step instructions for each part. Use clear headings and section breaks to organize the instructions, and avoid using specific boolean operation terms. Simply describe the desired effect of the operation when combining the current part with preceding CAD models. Provide only the instructions without any additional assumptions. Reference the given \"final shape\" description when creating the last part in the series. This will ensure that the final shape meets the specified dimensions and requirements.</description>",
