Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.125] Next, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane (face 1) of this coordinate system with the following components: * Line 1: Starting at (0.0, 0.0) and ending at (0.25, 0.0) * Line 2: Starting at (0.25, 0.0) and ending at (0.25, 0.125) * Line 3: Starting at (0.25, 0.125) and ending at (0.0, 0.125) * Line 4: Starting at (0.0, 0.125) and ending at (0.0, 0.0) Close the loop to complete the perimeter of the sketch. The loop consists of 4 lines. Proceed to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch with the following euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.125] Now, extrude the 2D sketch along the normal axis to create the 3D model of the part. Use the following parameters for the extrusion: * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.75 * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 * Sketch Scale: 0.25 * Operation: New solid body Part 2: Construct a metallic pipe with a tapered end. Start by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0438, 0.6438, 0.125] Now, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane (face 1) of this coordinate system with the following components: * Circle 1: Centered at (0.0312, 0.0312) with a radius of 0.0312 Close the loop to complete the circle. The loop consists of 1 circle.
