Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following Euler angles and translation vector: - Euler Angles: -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 - Translation Vector: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 On the default XY-plane, create a 2D sketch with the following sequence of lines on the given face (face_1): 1. Begin the sketch by creating a line (line_1) with a start point at [0.0, 0.0] and an end point at [0.0303, 0.0]. 2. Create line (line_2) with a start point at [0.0303, 0.0] and an end point at [0.0303, 0.0065]. 3. Create line (line_3) with a start point at [0.0303, 0.0065] and an end point at [0.0, 0.0065]. 4. Complete the rectangle by creating line (line_4) with a start point at [0.0, 0.0065] and an end point at [0.0, 0.0]. Note that each loop in a 2D sketch must be closed; thus, the start and end points of the four lines are the same. This iterative sequence results in a single rectangular loop. After creating the 2D sketch, scale the sketch_plane by a factor of 0.0303 using the sketch_scale parameter defined in the extrusion section. Next, transform the 2D sketch to a 3D sketch by defining the Euler angles and translation vector in the coordinate system section. The 3D sketch will have a thickness proportional to the scaling factor used earlier. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch (face_1) along the Z-axis with the following parameters: - Extrusion Depth Towards Normal: 0.75 - Operation: Add material This will generate a 3D model that represents a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The prism's dimensions are as follows: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.0303 - Height: 0.0303</description>",
