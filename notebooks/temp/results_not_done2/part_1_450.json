Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.163 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. **Intermediate CAD Part 3** **Construction Instructions** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0815, 0.0815, 0.1957. Create a new sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Within this sketch, create a single face (face\\\\_1). On face\\\\_1, create a loop (loop\\\\_1) consisting of a single circle (circle\\\\_1). The center of circle\\\\_1 should be located at 0.2935, 0.2935 and have a radius of 0.2935 units. Scale the sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.587. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by setting the euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and the translation vector to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0.

Furthermore, similar to Part 2, the operation (\\\\\"\n        ,\"CutFeatureOperation\\\\\"\n        ,\") is not explicitly stated in the description, which only uses the general phrase \\\\\"\n        ,\"generate the 3D model.\\\\\"\n        ,\"\\\\n\\\\n-Correction: Parts 2 and 3 of the description lack the specific detail required to perfectly match the corresponding `operation` fields in the JSON, and Part 3's extrusion depths are incompletely described.
