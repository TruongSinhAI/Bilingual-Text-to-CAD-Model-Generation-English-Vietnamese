    "prompt": "<description>**CAD Model Generation Instructions** **Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. For this part, the euler angles are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]. For the 2D sketch, draw the sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of one face (face_1). For face_1, create a loop (loop_1) that defines the shape of the sketch. Loop_1 consists of four lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4). * Line_1 starts at [0.0, 0.0] and ends at [0.75, 0.0]. * Line_2 starts at [0.75, 0.0] and ends at [0.75, 0.25]. * Line_3 starts at [0.75, 0.25] and ends at [0.0, 0.25]. * Line_4 starts at [0.0, 0.25] and ends at [0.0, 0.0] to close the loop. After you have created the 2D sketch, it's time to scale it using the sketch_scale parameter, which has a value of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following parameters: - Extrude_depth_towards_normal has a value of 0.375. - Extrude_depth_opposite_normal has a value of 0.0. - The sketch_scale parameter was used during the 2D sketch, so it has a value of 1.0 during the extrusion process. - The boolean operation for this part is a \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", which means it results in the creation of a new solid body. This part has the following dimensions: - The length is 0.75. - The width is 0.375. - The height is determined by the extrusion depth and is 0.75. This concludes the instructions for part 1, the three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Proceed to the next part's instructions when you're ready.</description>",
