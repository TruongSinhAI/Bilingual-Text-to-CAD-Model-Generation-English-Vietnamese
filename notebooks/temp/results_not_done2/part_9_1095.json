In this Sketch Face 1, there is a single loop with eight lines, as described below: 1. **Line 1:** Start Point [0.0, 0.0] and End Point [0.75, 0.0]. 2. **Line 2:** Start Point [0.75, 0.0] and End Point [0.75, 0.6429]. 3. **Line 3:** Start Point [0.75, 0.6429] and End Point [0.5357, 0.6429]. 4. **Line 4:** Start Point [0.5357, 0.6429] and End Point [0.5357, 0.2143]. 5. **Line 5:** Start Point [0.5357, 0.2143] and End Point [0.2143, 0.2143]. 6. **Line 6:** Start Point [0.2143, 0.2143] and End Point [0.2143, 0.4286]. 7. **Line 7:** Start Point [0.2143, 0.4286] and End Point [0.0, 0.4286]. 8. **Line 8:** Start Point [0.0, 0.4286] and End Point [0.0, 0.0]. These lines define the rectangular boundary of this part. However, there is a missing hole. **Inner Loop (Arc in Face 1)** To create the central cylindrical hole, there is another loop within the same Face 1, which is formed by two radii and an arc. 1. **Circle (implicit)**: Center Point [0.3725, 0.3187] andRadius 0.1058 (radius of the hole). 2. **Arc**: Start Point [0.4771, 0.2143], Mid Point [0.3725, 0.3187], and End Point [0.2777, 0.2143]. With this inner loop, the cylindrical hole is formed. **Completing the Extrusion** Extrude the sketch along the normal vector with the depth provided by the JSON (0.2143). Scale the sketch according to the provided scaling factor (0.75). This is a \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" as stated in the JSON, meaning it is the base part, not interacting with any prior parts.
