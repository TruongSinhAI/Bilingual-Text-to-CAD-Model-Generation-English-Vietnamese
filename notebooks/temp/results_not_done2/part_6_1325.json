This will serve as the base for our first part. Step 2: Create the Sketch Now let's create the 2D sketch for this part on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1) with multiple lines and loops, as described below. Face 1 * Loop 1 + Line 1: (0, 0) to (0.75, 0) + Line 2: (0.75, 0) to (0.75, 0.0228) + Line 3: (0.75, 0.0228) to (0.6978, 0.0228) + Line 4: (0.6978, 0.0228) to (0.6978, 0.0326) + Line 5: (0.6978, 0.0326) to (0.0522, 0.0326) + Line 6: (0.0522, 0.0326) to (0.0522, 0.0228) + Line 7: (0.0522, 0.0228) to (0, 0.0228) + Line 8: (0, 0.0228) to (0, 0) This loop forms a closed shape with eight line segments. Step 3: Transform the Sketch to 3D Apply the provided Euler angles and translation vector from the CAD assembly JSON to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. This step will rotate the sketch and move it to its desired position in 3D space. Step 4: Extrude the Sketch Using the extrusion depth values and sketch scaling parameter from the CAD assembly JSON, extrude the 2D sketch along its normal (Z-axis) to create the 3D model for this part. The final dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 (length) x 3 (width) x 4 (height). Part 1 Complete The first part of the assembly is now complete, which is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section.</description>",
