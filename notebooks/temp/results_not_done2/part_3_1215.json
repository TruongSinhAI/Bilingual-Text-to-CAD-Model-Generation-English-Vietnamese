    "prompt": "<description>**CAD Model Instructions** **Part 1** Construct a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. It has a smooth surface and appears to be a solid, three-dimensional shape. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0.0117, 0.0117, 0).

The second circle should have the same center but a radius of 0.0233. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.5859. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0117, 0.0117, 0.0]. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.75 units along the normal direction. The length, width, and height of this part are 0.5859, 0.5859, and 0.75 units, respectively. **Part 2** Create a simple, circular, hollow object with a smooth, curved surface. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0, 0, 0.75). For the 2D sketch, create a new face and draw two circles on this face. The first circle should have a center at (0.3047, 0.3047) and a radius of 0.3047. The second circle should have the same center but a radius of 0.293. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.6094. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.75]. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.0166 units along the opposite normal direction.

Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.3025, 0.3025, 0.75]. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.0586 units along the opposite normal direction. The length, width, and height of this part are 0.0043, 0.0043, and 0.0586 units, respectively. **Part 4** Create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The prism is composed of two larger rectangles and one smaller rectangle, all connected by straight lines. The smaller rectangle is positioned in the center of the larger rectangles. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0.0704, 0.2344, 0.75). For the 2D sketch, create two new faces and draw the four lines for each rectangle on each face.
