Scale the 2D sketch using a factor of 0.75. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system defined earlier. 5. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.125 units in both directions. Part 2: Tapered Wedge-Shaped Prism **Shape**: A three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The prism is slightly tapered towards the front, creating a wedge-like shape. The front face is angled slightly to the right. **Dimensions**: * Height: 0.375 units * Width: 0.125 units * Length: 0.375 units **Instructions**: 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles (0, 0, -90) and translation vector (0.375, 0.25, 0.125) for part 2, which is based on part 1. 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. **Face 1**: 1. Sketch a triangle with corner points (0, 0.375), (0.375, 0) and (0.375, 0.375). * Line 1: (0, 0.375) to (0.375, 0) * Line 2: (0.375, 0) to (0.375, 0.375) * Line 3: (0.375, 0.375) to (0, 0.375) 3. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.375. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system. 5. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0625 units in both directions. **Note**: This part will cut existing material from the previous part using the CutFeatureOperation boolean operation.</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description specifies two distinct parts, \\\"Part 1\\\" and \\\"Part 2\\\".
