For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and add a loop (loop\\\\_1) to it. Within this loop, add four lines. * Line 1: Start point at (0.0, 0.0), end point at (0.15, 0.0). * Line 2: Start point at (0.15, 0.0), end point at (0.15, 0.3). * Line 3: Start point at (0.15, 0.3), end point at (0.0, 0.3). * Line 4: Start point at (0.0, 0.3), end point at (0.0, 0.0). The sketch is now complete. To finalize this part, extrude the sketch by 0.75 units in the direction of the normal and apply a sketch scale factor of 0.3. This will result in a solid body with a height of 0.75 units. Part 2: Construct two cylindrical objects with a flat base and a tapered top, positioned parallel to each other with a slight overlap.
