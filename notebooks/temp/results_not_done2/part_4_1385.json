This will serve as the origin for our sketch. Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch Now, create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system, and follow these steps to create the required loops: Loop 1 on Face 1 1. Start at the point (0, 0.25) and draw a line segment to point (0.25, 0.25) 2. At the point (0.25, 0.25), draw a line segment to point (0.25, 0.5) 3. At the point (0.25, 0.5), draw a line segment to point (0.25, 0.75) 4. At the point (0.25, 0.75), draw a line segment to point (0, 0.75) 5. At the point (0, 0.75), draw a line segment to point (0, 0.25) Loop 1 on Face 1 completed with 5 line segments as described. Loop 1 on Face 2 1. Start at the point (0.25, 0) and draw a line segment to point (0.25, 0.25) 2. At the point (0.25, 0.25), draw a line segment to point (0.5, 0.25) 3. At the point (0.5, 0.25), draw a line segment to point (0.5, 0.0) 4. At the point (0.5, 0.0), draw a line segment to point (0.25, 0.0) Loop 1 on Face 2 completed with 4 line segments as described. Step 3: Apply sketch scale, euler_angles, and translation_vector Set the scaling parameter (sketch_scale) to 0.75. Define the euler angles and translation vector as instructed. Step 4: Extrude the sketch to create the 3D model Extrude the sketch 'face_1' by 0.25 units along the normal vector, and the opposite direction by 0 units. Set the operation to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" in order to create the final 3D model shape. Step 5: Describe the finished part Our final shape is a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top edge. Length: 0.75 Width: 0.75 Height: 0.25 Provide only these instructions for the given JSON file. Do not make any additional assumptions regarding the model.</description>",
