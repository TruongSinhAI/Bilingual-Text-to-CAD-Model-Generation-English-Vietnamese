    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Cylindrical Object with a Flat Top and Bottom and a Curved Side Step 1: Create the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with no rotation. Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch For this part, create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (face_1) of the coordinate system. Step 3: Create the Loops and Curves In this part, there are two loops - loop_1 and loop_2 - and four curves - line_1, arc_1, line_2, and arc_2 - that make up the loops. * **loop_1** is made up of two lines (line_1 and line_2) and two arcs (arc_1 and arc_2). + **line_1** starts at (0.1359, 0) and ends at (0.6141, 0). + **arc_1** starts at (0.6141, 0), has a midpoint at (0.75, 0.1359), and ends at (0.6141, 0.2718). + **line_2** starts at (0.6141, 0.2718) and ends at (0.1359, 0.2718). + **arc_2** starts at (0.1359, 0.2718), has a midpoint at (0.0, 0.1359), and ends at (0.1359, 0).0). * **loop_2** is not explicitly defined in the JSON, but since the object has a flat top and bottom, there should be a second loop with a single curve - a circle (circle_1) - representing the top surface of the object. + **circle_1** should have its center at (0.425, 0.2135) - the midpoint of line_1 and line_2 - and a radius of 0.1717 (half the length of line_1 or line_2). Also, note that all curves form closed loops. Step 4: Apply Constraints Ensure all lines and arcs are properly connected (tangent or perpendicular) to form the desired shape. Step 5: Define the Sketch Scale Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch to adjust its size. Step 6: Perform Extrusion Extrude the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D model with a depth of 0.2471 units along the Z-axis. The description says the height of the part should be approximately 0.247 units, but to match the final shape's height, set the extrude depth to 0.2471 units. Step 7: Describe the Part The part features a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side, having a rectangular opening on the side. Its dimensions are approximately 10 units in height and 5 units in width. The opening on the side is 2 units wide and 3 units tall. The object is centered in the image. The length of the part is 0.75 units, the width is also 0.75 units, and the height, when including the extrusion, is 0.2471 units. Please follow these instructions to complete Part 1, then proceed with Part 2 if there are more parts. The instructions provided are based on the JSON and should allow the junior CAD designer to create an accurate CAD model.</description>",
