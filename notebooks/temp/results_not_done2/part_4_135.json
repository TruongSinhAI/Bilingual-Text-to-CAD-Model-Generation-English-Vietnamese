The prism is centered in the image. 1. **Create a new coordinate system** with the following properties: - Euler Angles: ([-90.0, 0.0, -90.0]) - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 2. **Generate a 2D sketch** on the X-Y plane of the created coordinate system. Continue with the following steps for the sketch: a. **Draw line 1** from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.1929, 0.0). b. **Draw line 2** from point (0.1929, 0.0) to point (0.3283, 0.3352). c. **Draw line 3** from point (0.3283, 0.3352) to point (0.2594, 0.3352). d. **Draw line 4** from point (0.2594, 0.3352) to point (0.1378, 0.0551). e. **Draw line 5** from point (0.1378, 0.0551) to point (0.0528, 0.0551). f. **Draw line 6** from point (0.0528, 0.0551) to point (0.0528, 0.0964). g. **Draw line 7** from point (0.0528, 0.0964) to point (0.0, 0.0964). h. **Draw line 8** from point (0.0, 0.0964) to point (0.0, 0.0). The sketch will form a closed loop which defines the prism's bottom face. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** using the scaling factor = 0.3352. 4. **Transform the 2D scaled sketch into a 3D sketch** using the euler angles and translation vector of the coordinate system. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch** to generate the 3D prism with the following properties: - Extrude depth towards the normal: 0.75 - Extrude depth opposite the normal: 0.0 - Sketch scale: 0.3352 - Operation: Create a new solid body</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description outlines a single part: \\\"Part 1\\\".\\n\\npart_1: (Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism)\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Directly from description)\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Directly from description)\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1:\\n    - loop_1: (A closed loop defined by 8 lines)\\n      - line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.1929, 0.0] (Directly from description)\\n      - line_2: Start Point [0.1929, 0.0], End Point [0.3283, 0.3352] (Directly from description)\\n      - line_3: Start Point [0.3283, 0.3352], End Point [0.2594, 0.3352] (Directly from description)\\n      - line_4: Start Point [0.2594, 0.3352], End Point [0.1378, 0.0551] (Directly from description)\\n      - line_5: Start Point [0.1378, 0.0551], End Point [0.0528, 0.0551] (Directly from description)\\n      - line_6: Start Point [0.0528, 0.0551], End Point [0.0528, 0.0964] (Directly from description)\\n      - line_7: Start Point [0.0528, 0.0964], End Point [0.0, 0.0964] (Directly from description)\\n      - line_8: Start Point [0.0, 0.0964], End Point [0.0, 0.0] (Directly from description)\\n- extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.75 (Directly from description)\\n  - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Directly from description)\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.3352 (Directly from description)\\n  - operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (Inferred from \\\"Operation: Create a new solid body\\\")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n- Check coordinate system: The Euler angles and translation vector match the description precisely.\\n\\n- Check sketch:\\n  - The coordinates for all 8 lines are precisely as described.\\n  - The lines form a closed loop: Each line's end point matches the next line's start point, and the last line's end point matches the first line's start point.
