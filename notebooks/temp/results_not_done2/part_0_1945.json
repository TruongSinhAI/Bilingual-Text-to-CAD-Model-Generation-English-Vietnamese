The prism is solid and appears to be made of a uniform material. The hole is slightly larger than the width of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are not specified, but the hole is approximately half the width of the prism. The prism is the only object in the image. **Sketching the Base** 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles as (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector as (0, 0, 0) for this part. 2. In this coordinate system, sketch the base of the prism on a plane. The base is a rectangle with four lines. - Line 1: From (0, 0) to (0.64, 0) - Line 2: From (0.64, 0) to (0.64, 0.43) - Line 3: From (0.64, 0.43) to (0, 0.43) - Line 4: From (0, 0.43) to (0, 0) **Adding the Cylindrical Hole** 1. Create a circle for the cylindrical hole in the sketched rectangle. - Center: (0.32, 0.21) - Radius: 0.11 2. Scale the sketch by 0.64. 3. Create a new solid body by extruding the base sketch with the following parameters. - Extrude the depth towards normal to 0.11 units - Extrusion depth in the opposite direction of normal: 0 4. Note the shape, length, width and height of this intermediate CAD part. - Shape: A rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center - Length: 0.64 - Width: 0.64 - Height: 0.11 **Next Steps** Once this intermediate CAD part is generated, the subsequent parts for the CAD assembly will build upon this base part as per the defined operation in the CAD assembly JSON. Repeat the sketch, scaling, transformation, and extrusion process to generate all planned intermediate CAD parts. After all the intermediate parts are generated, they combine to create the final CAD model based on the JSON description and previously defined boolean operations.</description>",
