    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane. Create a circle using the center point at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.2812 units. Part 2 Create a new coordinate system at the translated position [0.0375, 0.0375, 0.2812]. No rotation is needed.
