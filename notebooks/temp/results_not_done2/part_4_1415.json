    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a simple, tapered rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. The final shape is a simple, tapered rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. The prism is slightly tapered, with the wider end at the top. The cylindrical hole is also slightly tapered, with the wider end at the bottom. The prism is positioned at a slight angle to the viewer. Start by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Now, let's draw the 2D sketch for the rectangular prism: 1. Create a new face (face_1) and draw a loop (loop_1) consisting of: * A line (line_1) from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.0131, 0.0]. * A line (line_2) from point [0.0131, 0.0] to point [0.0131, 0.0512]. * A line (line_3) from point [0.0131, 0.0512] to point [0.0, 0.0512]. * A line (line_4) from point [0.0, 0.0512] to point [0.0, 0.0]. The loop is closed, with all points connected, forming a rectangular shape. Next, let's create the parametric 3D model from the 2D sketch: 1. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.0512 (sketch_scale). 2. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given Euler angles and translation vector. 3. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following parameters: * Extrude depth towards the normal (extrude_depth_towards_normal): 0.0 * Extrude depth opposite the normal (extrude_depth_opposite_normal): 0.75 After creating the rectangular prism, let's create the cylindrical hole using a separate sketch to be subtracted from the prism: 1. Create a new sketch (face_2) on the top of the prism. 2. Draw a circle (circle_1) with the center location at [0.0066, 0.0512], and a radius of 0.0066, intersecting with the prism's top surface. 3. Extrude the circle (circle_1) as a cylinder through the entire prism with a slightly tapered shape, reaching the bottom surface (wider end at the bottom). The cylinder should be slightly smaller than the rectangular prism. Operation: The cylindrical hole is subtracted from the rectangular prism to create the desired final shape (implicitly assuming the 'CutFeatureOperation'). The resulting final shape is a simple, tapered rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center, positioned at a slight angle to the viewer. The length, width, and height of Part 1 and the final shape are as follows: * Length: 0.0512 m * Width: 0.75 m * Height: 0.0512 m These instructions provide the natural language basis for constructing the parametric CAD model in accordance with the provided CAD Assembly JSON. The junior CAD designer should use this as a guide while generating the actual 3D CAD model or any other visualization.</description>",
