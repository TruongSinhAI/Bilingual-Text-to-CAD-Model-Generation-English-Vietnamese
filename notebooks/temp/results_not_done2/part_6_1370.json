Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 - Translation Vector: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 Next, move on to the sketching stage. The sketch should be drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of two faces, face\\\\_1 and face\\\\_2. Face 1 Face\\\\_1 has two loops, loop\\\\_1 and loop\\\\_2. Loop 1 Loop 1 is a closed loop consisting of the following curves: - Line 1: Start Point - (0.1125, 0.0), End Point - (0.6375, 0.0) - Arc 1: Start Point - (0.6375, 0.0), Mid Point - (0.75, 0.1125), End Point - (0.6375, 0.225) - Line 2: Start Point - (0.6375, 0.225), End Point - (0.1125, 0.225) - Arc 2: Start Point - (0.1125, 0.225), Mid Point - (0.0, 0.1125), End Point - (0.1125, 0.0) Loop 2 Loop 2 is a closed loop consisting of the following curves: - Line 1: Start Point - (0.1125, 0.0187), End Point - (0.6375, 0.0187) - Arc 1: Start Point - (0.6375, 0.0187), Mid Point - (0.7312, 0.1125), End Point - (0.6375, 0.2062) - Line 2: Start Point - (0.6375, 0.2062), End Point - (0.1125, 0.2062) - Arc 2: Start Point - (0.1125, 0.2062), Mid Point - (0.0187, 0.1125), End Point - (0.1125, 0.0187) Face 2 Face\\\\_2 has no curves or loops. It is simply a flat face. Now, proceed to the extrusion step. Extrude the sketch by 0.15 units towards the normal and by 0.0 units in the opposite direction of the normal. Scale the sketch by 0.75. This creates the final shape, which is a rectangular prism with a curved top and bottom. The prism has a flat bottom and a flat top, and it is slightly tilted to the right. The top and bottom edges of the prism are curved, creating a smooth appearance. The prism is centered in the image. The length, width, and height of the part are 0.15, 0.75, and 0.75 units respectively. This concludes the construction of part 1. The final shape is a CAD model of a rectangular prism with a curved top and bottom.</description>",
