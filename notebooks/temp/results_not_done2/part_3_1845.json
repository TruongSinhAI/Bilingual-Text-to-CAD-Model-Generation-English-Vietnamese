For the sketch, create a new face: - Create **loop 1** on face 1 of the sketch plane. - Within loop 1, create the following lines: - **line 1**: Start point (0.0, 0.0), End point (0.75, 0.0). - **line 2**: Start point (0.75, 0.0), End point (0.75, 0.75). - **line 3**: Start point (0.75, 0.75), End point (0.0, 0.75). - **line 4**: Start point (0.0, 0.75), End point (0.0, 0.0). This loop creates a rectangle on the sketch plane. 3. **Scale** the sketch with a scale factor of 0.75. 4. **Extrude** the sketch along the normal vector with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.0 and an extrusion depth opposite the normal of 0.375, which corresponds to the height of the prism. 5. This operation creates a new solid body - the rectangular prism. **Part 2: Construct a three-dimensional, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top.** 1. **Create a new coordinate system** with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector (0.1569, 0.1569, 0.375). 2. For the sketch, create a new face: - Create **loop 1** on face 1 of the sketch plane. - Within loop 1, create **circle\\\\_1**: Center (0.2181, 0.2181), Radius 0.2181. This loop creates a circle on the sketch plane, representing the top surface of the cylinder. 3. **Scale** the sketch with a scale factor of 0.4362. 4. **Extrude** the sketch along the normal vector with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.375 and an extrusion depth opposite the normal of 0.0. 5. This operation joins the cylindrical object to the rectangular prism generated in the previous step. **Part 3: Cut a tapered rectangular prism from the existing solid.** 1. **Create a new coordinate system** with euler angles -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 and translation vector (0.375, 0.036, 0.4488). 2. For the sketch, create a new face: - Create **loop 1** on face 1 of the sketch plane. - Within loop 1, create the following lines: - **line 1**: Start point (0.0, 0.5235), End point (0.0336, 0.2416). - **line 2**: Start point (0.0336, 0.2416), End point (0.7719, 0.0). - **line 3**: Start point (0.7719, 0.0), End point (0.7719, 0.5235). - **line 4**: Start point (0.7719, 0.5235), End point (0.0, 0.5235). This loop creates a rectangle on the sketch plane. 3. **Scale** the sketch with a scale factor of 0.7719. 4. **Extrude** the sketch along the normal vector with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.1875 and an extrusion depth opposite the normal of 0.1875. 5. This operation cuts a tapered rectangular prism from the solid generated in the previous steps. The final CAD model represents a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat top and bottom, and the cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The prism is slightly tilted to the right.</description>",
