It has a smooth surface and appears to be made of a solid material, with symmetry along its length, suggesting it could be used for mechanical or structural purposes. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Create a new coordinate system with no rotation or translation. This will serve as the base for constructing the CAD model. Step 2: Draw the first 2D sketch 1. Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw two overlapping circles, one with a radius of 0.0317 units and another with a radius of 0.0226 units. * The first circle will be the base of the cylindrical object, while the second one will be the top of the tapered end. * Make sure the circles share the same center point, located at (0.0317, 0.0317). Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the entire 2D sketch by a factor of 0.0634. This will determine the overall size of the cylindrical object. Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch 1. Set the euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) in degrees to maintain symmetry. 2. Define the translation vector to be (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) since there's no need for translation. 3. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the defined Euler angles and translation vector. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model 1. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.75 units. 2. Extrude the 2D sketch in the opposite direction of the normals by 0.0 units. 3. Set the sketch scaling to 0.0634 units. This completes the construction for Part 1. The resulting shape will be a solid cylindrical object with a tapered end, having the length, width, and height as follows: * Length: 0.0634 units * Width: 0.0634 units * Height: 0.75 units</description>",

The rectangle should be centered at the origin of the coordinate system. Add a linear constraint to the two vertical edges of the rectangle, with a slope of 1 and an intercept of 0.
