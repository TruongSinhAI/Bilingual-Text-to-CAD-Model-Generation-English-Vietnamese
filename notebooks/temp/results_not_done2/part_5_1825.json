    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-dimensional, metallic, hollow, curved, looped structure with a flat base** Before proceeding, let's break down the given information to understand the structure we need to create. The structure has a flat base and a curved surface with two loops. We'll create this part in four steps: 1. Define a coordinate system. 2. Draw a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. 3. Scale the 2D sketch. 4. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D model by extruding. **Step 1: Define a coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0542, 0.087] **Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch** Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the defined coordinate system. The sketch consists of two loopsâ€”loop 1 and loop 2, both on the same plane. Loop 1 Draw the following lines and arcs in order to form a closed loop: 1. Line 1: Start at [0.0, 0.0], End at [0.185, 0.0] 2. Arc 1: Start at [0.185, 0.0], Mid at [0.75, 0.2571], End at [0.1767, 0.4951] 3. Line 2: Start at [0.1767, 0.4951], End at [0.0, 0.4951] 4. Line 3: Start at [0.0, 0.4951], End at [0.0, 0.0] (This line connects loop 1, closing it.) Loop 2 Draw the following lines and arcs in order to form a closed loop: 1. Line 1: Start at [0.0451, 0.0451], End at [0.1968, 0.0451] 2. Arc 1: Start at [0.1968, 0.0451], Mid at [0.7093, 0.2567], End at [0.1896, 0.45] 3. Line 2: Start at [0.1896, 0.45], End at [0.0451, 0.45] 4. Line 3: Start at [0.0451, 0.45], End at [0.0451, 0.0451] (This line connects loop 2, closing it.) **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0542 units and opposite normal by 0 units. The final shape will be a three-dimensional, metallic, hollow, curved, looped structure with a flat base. **Dimensions:** - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.0542 - Height: 0.75</description>",
