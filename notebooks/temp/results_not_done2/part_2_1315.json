The length of the curved side is twice the length of the flat sides. The height of the prism is half the length of the curved side. To construct this part, follow these steps: **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler Angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.0735, 0.0]. This will position and orient the 2D sketch plane for the first face. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch for the first face** Create a new 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. Draw a rectangle by creating four lines (labeled as line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, and line\\\\_4) as described below: 1. line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0792, 0.0] 2. line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.0792, 0.0], End Point [0.0792, 0.75] 3. line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.0792, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] 4. line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. **Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the rotation and translation defined by the coordinate system. **Step 5: Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the first part** Extrude the 3D sketch along its normal direction by a distance of 0.0735 units. This will create the first part of the final assembly, which is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom and a curved side. The length of the curved side is approximately 0.75 units (twice the length of the flat sides), the width is approximately 0.0735 units, and the height is the same as the extrusion depth (0.0735 units).</description>",
