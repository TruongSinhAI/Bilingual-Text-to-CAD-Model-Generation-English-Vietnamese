Step 5: Extrude the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0938 and opposite normal direction by 0.0 to create the 3D model. This operation results in the creation of a new solid body with a flat top and bottom. The prism is slightly tilted to the right with the dimensions as follows: - Height: 0.75 - Width: 0.0938 - Length: 0.75 Continue with the next parts using similar step-by-step instructions as provided above.
