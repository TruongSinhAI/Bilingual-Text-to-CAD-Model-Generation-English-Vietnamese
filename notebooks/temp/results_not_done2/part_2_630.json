    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Instructions Create the base of the rectangular prism The base of the rectangular prism is a rectangle with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the sides are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The top and bottom faces are slightly larger than the side faces. 1. **Define the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0147, 0.0] 2. **Draw the 2D sketch for the base** Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the defined coordinate system. Draw a rectangle by creating four lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.2609] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.2609], End Point [0.0, 0.2609] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.2609], End Point [0.0, 0.0] 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch** Use the euler angles and the translation vector from the coordinate system to transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch. 5. **Extrude the 3D Sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 3D Sketch along the normal vector by a distance of 0.0073, and in the opposite direction of the normal by the same distance (0.0073). This will create the base of the rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Final shape information The final shape is a rectangular prism with the following dimensions: - Length: ~0.75 units - Width: ~0.0147 units - Height: ~0.75 units</description>",
