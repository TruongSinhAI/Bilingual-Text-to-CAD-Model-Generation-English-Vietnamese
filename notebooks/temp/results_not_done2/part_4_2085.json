However, the JSON structure for part_1's sketch shows only `face_1` containing both `loop_1` and `loop_2`.- If `face_2` was intended as a separate face in the JSON, it would be a sibling to `face_1` within the `sketch` object, not contain `loop_2` as a sibling to `loop_1` within `face_1`. This is a direct contradiction between the textual instruction and the JSON structure.- The JSON's structure `face_1: {loop_1: {...}, loop_2: {...}}` indicates two distinct loops within *one* face.- Part 2 and Part 3 operation:- The description for Part 2 and Part 3 does not explicitly state the `operation` type (\\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" or \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\"). However, these are standard operations for subsequent parts when building a complex model. The JSON correctly specifies \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" for Part 2 and \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" for Part 3, which are reasonable inferences for additive and subtractive operations given the context of building a multi-part object.- All other parameters (coordinate system values, circle centers/radii, extrusion depths, sketch scales) for all parts match precisely between the description and the JSON.- Correction: The main discrepancy is how the sketch loops are structured for Part 1. The description implies two distinct faces (`face_1` and `face_2`), while the JSON shows two loops (`loop_1` and `loop_2`) under a single `face_1`. This makes the JSON not fully conform to the description for Part 1's sketch structure. Therefore, the overall validity is 'No'.</think>"
