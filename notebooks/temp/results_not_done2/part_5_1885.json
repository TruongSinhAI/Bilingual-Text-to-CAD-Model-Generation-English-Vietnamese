This will be the cross-section of the cylindrical object. **Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 5: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Create a transformation from the 2D sketch to a 3D sketch by extruding the sketch by 0.75 units in the positive Z direction. **Step 6: Complete the parametric model** Set the extrusion depth towards the normal vector to 0.75 units and the opposite normal vector to 0.0 units. The sketch scaling parameter should be set to 0.75. The boolean operation is a new body feature operation. This creates a new solid body that represents the cylindrical object described in the prompt. The height of this intermediate part is 0.75 units, and its width and length are also 0.75 units. Note: The central hole in the object is not explicitly mentioned in the provided JSON, but it can be inferred from the description of the final shape. Therefore, the circular loop in the sketch should be interpreted as a cross-section of the outer surface of the object. The inner diameter of the cylindrical section should be slightly smaller than the outer diameter. This can be achieved by creating a second sketch that represents the inner surface of the object and subtracting it from the first sketch using a cut feature operation. The exact dimensions of the inner surface will depend on the desired size and shape of the central hole.</description>",
