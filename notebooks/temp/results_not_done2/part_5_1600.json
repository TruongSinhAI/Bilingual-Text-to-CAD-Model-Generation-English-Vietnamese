The prism has no holes, cavities, or undercuts in it. Please note that since the `CAD Assembly JSON` and the information provided do not explicitly call out loops and faces, this is an interpretation of how the given JSON represents the construction of the CAD model. To further clarify: - Each line segment and arc in the sketch may be considered a separate curve. - The loops are the closed sequences of curves (lines and arcs) that define the boundaries of the faces. - The faces are the planar or curved regions on the CAD part, defined by the loops. For Part 1, the instructions follow this general structure to create a rectangular prism: - Sketch a rectangle (sequence of lines and arcs) with specific dimensions [loop_1] - Extrude the rectangle into a 3D prism [extrusion_1] Additionally, for future reference, you can create cylindrical or other curved shapes by following the below structure: - Sketch curves (circles, arcs, or lines) that define a curved shape on the 2D sketch plane [loop_1] - Extrude or revolve the curves into a 3D body (depending on the cross-sections and design intent) [extrusion_1 or revolution_1]</description>",
