Scale the 2D sketch using the `sketch_scale` of 0.724 to maintain the correct aspect ratio for the prism. 5. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and Translation Vector from the `coordinate_system`. 6. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value (0.3713) to generate the 3D prism model. Use the `operation` of \"       , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"       , \" for this part. Part 2: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom The second part to construct is another three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. This prism has a different size than Part 1. 1. Create a new coordinate system based on the provided `coordinate_system` data. Set the Euler angles as [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector as [0.3787, 0.3713, 0.0092]. 2. Create a 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch should contain one face (face_1). 3. Add a loop (loop_1) to face_1 with four lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4) that create a rectangle. The Start and End Points for each line are as follows: - line_1: [0.0, 0.0] > [0.3713, 0.0] - line_2: [0.3713, 0.0] > [0.3713, 0.3899] - line_3: [0.3713, 0.3899] > [0.0, 0.3899] - line_4: [0.0, 0.3899] > [0.0, 0.0] 4. Scale the 2D sketch using the `sketch_scale` of 0.3899. 5. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and Translation Vector from the `coordinate_system`. 6. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value (0.3713) to generate the 3D prism model. For this part, use the `operation` of \"       , \"JoinFeatureOperation\"       , \" to combine it with the preceding CAD model. </description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: From the description, we have two parts, \"       , \"part_1\"       , \" and \"       , \"part_2\"       , \".\\n\\npart_1:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From description).\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.3713, 0.0] (From description).\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.724, 0.0] (From description).\\n----line_2: Start [0.724, 0.0], End [0.724, 0.724] (From description).\\n----line_3: Start [0.724, 0.724], End [0.0, 0.724] (From description).\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.724], End [0.0, 0.0] (From description).\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.3713 (From description).\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred as not specified).\\n--sketch_scale: 0.724 (From description).\\n--operation: \"       , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"       , \" (From description).\\n\\npart_2:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From description).\\n--Translation Vector: [0.3787, 0.3713, 0.0092] (From description).\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.3713, 0.0] (From description).\\n----line_2: Start [0.3713, 0.0], End [0.3713, 0.3899] (From description).\\n----line_3: Start [0.3713, 0.3899], End [0.0, 0.3899] (From description).\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.3899], End [0.0, 0.0] (From description).\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.3713 (From description).\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred as not specified).\\n--sketch_scale: 0.3899 (From description).\\n--operation: \"       , \"JoinFeatureOperation\"       , \" (From description).\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Part 1 Sketch Geometry:\\nLine 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.724, 0.0]\\nLine 2: [0.724, 0.0] to [0.724, 0.724]\\nLine 3: [0.724, 0.724] to [0.0, 0.724]\\nLine 4: [0.0, 0.724] to [0.0, 0.0]\\nThe lines form a closed rectangular loop, with each line's end point matching the next line's start point, and the last line closing back to the first.
