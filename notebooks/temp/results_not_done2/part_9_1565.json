The sides are parallel and meet at right angles, and it is centered on a white background. **Step 1: Draw a 2D sketch** Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with no rotation. Create a new sketch on the XY plane and draw eight connected lines as follows: 1. Line 1: Starting point at (0, 0.5), ending point at (0, 0.75). 2. Line 2: Starting point at (0, 0.75), ending point at (0.5, 0.75). 3. Line 3: Starting point at (0.5, 0.75), ending point at (0.5, 0.5). 4.
