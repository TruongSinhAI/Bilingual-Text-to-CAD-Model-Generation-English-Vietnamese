The resulting CAD model should match the final shape described in the JSON. The height, width, and length of each of the intermediate parts and the final shape are provided in the JSON description. The specific boolean operation terms have been avoided, and their natural language descriptions have been used instead. The details of all the curves, loops, and faces have been described, allowing the junior CAD designer to generate an accurate CAD model.</description>",
