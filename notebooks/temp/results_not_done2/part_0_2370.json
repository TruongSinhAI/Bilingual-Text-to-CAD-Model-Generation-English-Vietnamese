Face 1: - Loop 1: - Arc 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], Mid Point [0.082, 0.0129], End Point [0.1602, 0.0408] - Arc 2: Start Point [0.1602, 0.0408], Mid Point [0.1345, 0.0787], End Point [0.1151, 0.1203] - Arc 3: Start Point [0.1151, 0.1203], Mid Point [0.0519, 0.0655], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Face 2: - Loop 1: - Arc 1: Start Point [0.3272, 0.4967], Mid Point [0.3722, 0.5017], End Point [0.4174, 0.4995] - Arc 2: Start Point [0.4174, 0.4995], Mid Point [0.4013, 0.5775], End Point [0.3716, 0.6515] - Arc 3: Start Point [0.3716, 0.6515], Mid Point [0.3424, 0.5761], End Point [0.3272, 0.4967] Face 3: - Loop 1: - Arc 1: Start Point [0.5998, 0.0384], Mid Point [0.6734, 0.0147], End Point [0.75, 0.0039] - Arc 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0039], Mid Point [0.7021, 0.064], End Point [0.6447, 0.115] - Arc 3: Start Point [0.6447, 0.115], Mid Point [0.6253, 0.0749], End Point [0.5998, 0.0384] **Extrusion** Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with a depth of 0.1803. Do not extrude in the opposite direction. Apply a sketch scale of 0.75 to the sketch before extruding. This part represents a rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one side. The length and width of this part are both 0.75 units, and the height is 0.1803 units.</description>",
