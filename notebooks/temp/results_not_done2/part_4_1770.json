This sketch will be comprised of a single face (face_1) which will be further divided into four loops. *face\\\\_1:* - *loop\\\\_1:* + *arc\\\\_1:* Start Point: [0, 0.2608], Mid Point: [0.375, 0], End Point: [0.75, 0.2608] + *line\\\\_1:* Start Point: [0.75, 0.2608], End Point: [0.75, 0.4] + *line\\\\_2:* Start Point: [0.75, 0.4], End Point: [0, 0.4] + *line\\\\_3:* Start Point: [0, 0.4], End Point: [0, 0.2608] The resulting shape should resemble a rectangle with a semi-circle at the bottom-right corner. Once the sketch is complete, scale it uniformly by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch scale parameter. Now, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by setting the euler angles to [0, 0, 0] and the translation vector to [0, 0, 0]. After that, extrude the 3D sketch along its normal direction with a depth of 0.15 units. **Part 2: Create a cylindrical hole at the center of the rectangular prism** Start by creating a new coordinate system using these parameters: - Euler Angles: [0, 0, 180] - Translation Vector: [0.3, 0.3358, 0] Draw the 2D sketch for this part on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch will contain one face (face\\\\_1) and one loop. *face\\\\_1:* - *loop\\\\_1:* + *circle\\\\_1:* Center: [0.075, 0.075], Radius: 0.075 The resulting shape should be a circle. Now, scale the 2D sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.15 using the sketch scale parameter. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles [0, 0, 180] and the translation vector [0, 0, 0]. After that, extrude the 3D sketch along its normal direction with a depth of 0.25 units towards the opposite direction of normals. Finally, use the 'CutFeatureOperation' to subtract the cylindrical hole from the previously created rectangular prism.</description>",
