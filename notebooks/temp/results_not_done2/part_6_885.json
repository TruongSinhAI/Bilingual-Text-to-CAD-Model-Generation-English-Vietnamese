The object is symmetrical along its central axis and has a smooth surface. The rectangular hole is also symmetrical and centered in the object. **Step 1: Creating the Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for this part. The euler angles for this system should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees, and the translation vector should be set to [0.0, 0.3139, 0.0]. **Step 2: Drawing the Sketch** Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system created in step 1. The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1) with one loop (loop\\\\_1). Loop\\\\_1 consists of four curves: - Line 1: Starting at [0.5004, 0.0] and ending at [0.745, 0.0]. - Arc 1: Starting at [0.745, 0.0], with a midpoint at [0.0, 0.0638], and ending at [0.7458, 0.1169]. - Line 2: Starting at [0.7458, 0.1169] and ending at [0.5028, 0.1169]. - Arc 2: Starting at [0.5028, 0.1169], with a midpoint at [0.2356, 0.064], and ending at [0.5004, 0.0]. **Step 3: Transforming the Sketch into 3D** Transform the 2D sketch drawn in step 2, into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system created in step 1, and applying a scaling factor of 0.7458 to the sketch. **Step 4: Extruding the Sketch to Create the 3D Model** Extrude the 3D sketch created in step 3, a distance of 0.0938 towards the normal, and a distance of 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal. The resulting part is a cylindrical object with a rectangular hole in the center, symmetrical along its central axis, and with a smooth surface.
