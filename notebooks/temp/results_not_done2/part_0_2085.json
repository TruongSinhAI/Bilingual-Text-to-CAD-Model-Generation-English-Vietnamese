    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: A long, thin, metallic object with a pointed end** **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin of the CAD model. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees, and the translation vector to 0.0, 0.375, 0.0. This will position the coordinate system at the desired location and orientation. **Step 2: Create the 2D sketch** Using the newly created coordinate system, create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. In the sketch, create the following faces and loops: - Face 1: - Loop 1: - Line 1: Start point (0.0, 0.0), end point (0.0156, 0.0) - Line 2: Start point (0.0156, 0.0), end point (0.0156, 0.0078) - Line 3: Start point (0.0156, 0.0078), end point (0.0109, 0.0078) - Line 4: Start point (0.0109, 0.0078), end point (0.0109, 0.0061) - Line 5: Start point (0.0109, 0.0061), end point (0.014, 0.0061) - Line 6: Start point (0.014, 0.0061), end point (0.014, 0.0017) - Line 7: Start point (0.014, 0.0017), end point (0.0017, 0.0017) - Line 8: Start point (0.0017, 0.0017), end point (0.0017, 0.0061) - Line 9: Start point (0.0017, 0.0061), end point (0.0047, 0.0061) - Line 10: Start point (0.0047, 0.0061), end point (0.0047, 0.0078) - Line 11: Start point (0.0047, 0.0078), end point (0.0, 0.0078) - Line 12: Start point (0.0, 0.0078), end point (0.0, 0.0) This sketch forms a complex shape with multiple curves and loops. There are 12 lines in total, forming a closed loop that defines the shape. **Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.0156, using the sketch\\\\_scale scaling parameter. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system defined earlier. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector to a depth of 0.375 units, producing a 3D model that matches the desired shape. The boolean operation for this intermediate part is NewBodyFeatureOperation, which adds new material to the CAD model. The final shape has a length of 0.0156 units, a width of 0.375 units, and a height of 0.0156 units. **Additional Information:** The long, thin, metallic object with a pointed end is the first intermediate CAD part in the assembly. It has a length of 0.0156 units, a width of 0.375 units, and a height of 0.0156 units. The object is constructed by creating a coordinate system, defining a 2D sketch with multiple lines and loops, scaling the sketch, and extruding it into a 3D model. The final shape is a solid body that adds new material to the overall CAD model.</description>",
