Face 1: - Loop 1: Draw a circle centered at [0.15, 0.15] with a radius of 0.15. - Loop 2: Draw a smaller circle centered at [0.15, 0.15] with a radius of 0.05. 2.

Step 4: Transform the Sketch into 3D Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using a rotation of 0 degrees around the X, Y, and Z axes and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Step 5: Extrude the Sketch to Create the 3D Model Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.2 units. This will create the final shape which is a cylindrical object with a rectangular hole in the center, a flat base, and a slightly tapered top. The hole is circular and located near the center of the cylinder. The object appears to be made of a solid material with dimensions 0.75 (length) x 0.75 (width) x 0.2 (height) units. Note that this is a new solid body generation.</description>",

Extrude with the following depth: * extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.525 (towards the positive direction along the Z-axis) * extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 The Part 1 shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, with a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.525 units, and a height of 0.75 units. **Additional Information** 1. Every loop is closed. 2. A loop can consist of multiple lines and/or arcs. 3. A loop cannot consist of a line and a circle. 4. A loop cannot consist of an arc and a circle. 5. Avoid using a line and a circle or an arc and a circle in the same loop. 6. Lines can only be connected to other lines or curves (arcs, circles) where the end of one curve (line, arc, or circle) meets the beginning of another. 7. For a clean CAD model, keep the number of faces minimal and ensure that adjacent faces share a common edge. 8. Follow the right-hand rule when defining the positive direction of an extrusion. 9. Make sure that the geometry is fully defined (all the necessary dimensions, constraints, and relations are specified) before proceeding to the extrusion step. 10. Adjust the height, width, and length variables for each part accordingly. 11. Keep the overall design well-organized and streamlined for clarity. This example demonstrates a disciplined approach for generating a parametric CAD model using clear and concise instructions suited to a junior CAD designer. By following these guidelines, you ensure accuracy, simplicity, and efficiency in creating a CAD model.</description>",
