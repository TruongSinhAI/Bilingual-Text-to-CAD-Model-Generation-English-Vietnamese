    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top and Bottom The shape being constructed is a rectangular prism with a tapered top and bottom. We will begin by creating a new coordinate system. Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.3239, 0.0] Next, create the 2D sketch for the first face of the prism by following these steps: 1. Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.5455, 0.0]. 2. Draw a line from point [0.5455, 0.0] to point [0.0, 0.75]. 3. Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.75] to point [0.0, 0.0]. This completes face_1. Now, create the 2D sketch for the second face of the prism by following these steps: 1. Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.75] to point [0.5455, 0.0]. 2. Draw a line from point [0.5455, 0.0] to point [0.5455, 0.75]. 3. Draw a line from point [0.5455, 0.75] to point [0.0, 0.75]. These three lines form a closed loop, which completes face_2. After scaling the 2D sketch by the provided scaling parameter (sketch_scale = 0.75), we need to transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along its normal by 0.1619 units, and also extrude the sketch by the same amount in the opposite direction of the normal. The height, width, and length of this intermediate part are 0.75 (height), 0.3239 (width), and 0.75 (length) units, respectively. Moving on to the next part, keep in mind that each part needs to be built upon the previously constructed part. This ensures that the CAD model is constructed correctly, and all the parts combine to form the final CAD model.

Consider providing the complete JSON to generate accurate instructions for the remaining parts.)</description>",
