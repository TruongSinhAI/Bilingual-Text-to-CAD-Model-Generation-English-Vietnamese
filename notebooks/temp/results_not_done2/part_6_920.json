This rectangle represents the base of the prism. Extruding the base 1. Extrude the base by 0.4286 units in the positive Z direction. **Part 1 description:** This part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The top and bottom sections are parallel to each other, while the middle section is perpendicular to both. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. The dimensions are 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.4286 units. Part 2: Create a cylindrical hole in the prism Sketching the hole profile 1. Create a new coordinate system with Euler Angles set to (-90, 0, -90) and a Translation Vector set to (0, 0.4821, 0). 2. Create a new sketch on the XY plane. 3. Draw a circle centered at (0.0536, 0.2143) with a radius of 0.0536 units. This forms the circular section of the cylindrical hole. Drawing the curved surface 1. Create a new sketch on the cylindrical face resulting from the previous extrusion of the first part. 2. Draw an arc from the point (0.0536, 0.4286) to the point (0.2679, 0.2143) using a suitable radius and direction of curvature which matches the part's circular section. Drawing the straight surface 1. Draw a line from the point (0.2679, 0.2143) to the point (0.2679, 0.4286). 2. Draw a line from the point (0.2679, 0.4286) to the point (0.0536, 0.4286) creating the remaining surfaces of the hole. Extruding the hole 1. Extrude the hole surfaces by 0.5893 units in the negative Z direction to cut the prism's material. **Part 2 description:** The second part is a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat bottom and a flat top. The cylindrical hole is centered on the prism's axis and is the same height as the prism. The prism is gray. The dimensions of the prism are 0.5893 x 0.4286 x 0.4286 units, and the cylindrical hole has a diameter that is 0.1072 units smaller than the width and height of the prism.</description>",
