Draw the first face of the prism by creating a loop with the following four lines: - Line 1: Start point at 0.0, 0.0 and end point at 0.525, 0.0 - Line 2: Start point at 0.525, 0.0 and end point at 0.525, 0.15 - Line 3: Start point at 0.525, 0.15 and end point at 0.0, 0.15 - Line 4: Start point at 0.0, 0.15 and end point at 0.0, 0.0 5. Scale the prism by setting the sketch scale to 0.525. 6. Perform a cut operation with a depth of 0.15 along the opposite normal direction. Shape Description: The final shape will be a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. The first part forms the majority of the prism, with a length of 0.75, a width of 0.75, and a height of 0.375. The second part cuts a section out of the first part, with a length of 0.525, a width of 0.525, and a height of 0.15. This leaves us with a final shape that is slightly tapered on the top and bottom.</description>",

The JSON clearly defines `extrude_depth_towards_normal` as 0.375, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` as 0.0, `sketch_scale` as 0.75, and `operation` as \"                         , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"                         , \".

The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` being 0.0 is correctly inferred for a cut in only the opposite direction.\\n\\n- Correction: The description is incomplete because it fails to provide any extrusion details for `part_1`, which are present in the JSON.
