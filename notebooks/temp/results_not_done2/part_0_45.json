    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1 Instructions** Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered shape, narrowing slightly towards the bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation. *Step 1: Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane* Create a circle with Center at (0.375, 0.375) and Radius of 0.375. *Step 2: Scale the sketch* Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.75. *Step 3: Transform the scaled sketch into 3D geometry* Maintaining the current coordinate system, extrude the circle along the Z-axis by 0.0326 units (towards the normal) using \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\". This will create a new solid cylindrical object with a slight taper. **Part 2 Instructions** Construct another cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, similar to Part 1, but with a bigger taper towards the middle of the part. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: Euler Angles=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0 the Translation Vector=[0.0326, 0.0326, 0.0]. *Step 1: Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane* Create a circle with Center at (0.3424, 0.3424) and Radius of 0.3424. *Step 2: Scale the sketch* Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.6848 to match the dimensions in the description. *Step 3: Transform the scaled sketch into 3D geometry* Maintaining the current coordinate system, extrude the circle along the Z-axis by 0.163 units (towards the normal) using \"JoinFeatureOperation\". This will add the new cylindrical object to the assembly created in Part 1, and maintain continuity between the parts. The resulting CAD model should resemble the provided description of the final shape. The dimensions of the final CAD model will be as follows: Final shape dimensions: - Length: 0.6848 - Width: 0.6848 - Height: 0.1957 The height includes the original height from Part 1 (0.0326) and the additional height from Part 2 (0.163).</description>",
