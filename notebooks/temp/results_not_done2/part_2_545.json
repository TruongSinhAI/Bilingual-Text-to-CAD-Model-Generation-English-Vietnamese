    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for the first part. The Euler angles are set to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is set to [0.375, 0.0, 0.0099]. This will position the sketch plane correctly for the upcoming steps. The first face of the sketch contains a single loop, which in turn consists of three connected lines (line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, and line\\\\_3). Here are the details about these curves: - line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0551, 0.3165] - line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.0551, 0.3165], End Point [0.0, 0.3164] - line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.0, 0.3164], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This loop is closed and has three lines. Next, scale this 2D sketch by a factor of 0.3165 using the `sketch_scale` parameter specified. This will adjust the dimensions of the sketch according to the design requirements. Now, we need to transform the 2D sketch to 3D space. We'll be using the given Euler angles (-90.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector [0.375, 0.0, 0.0099] as input for the transformation. This will position the sketch surface according to the specified coordinate system, ready for the next steps. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.375 along the normal direction to create the 3D model. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. The length of this part is 0.375, the width is 0.3165, and the height is 0.3165. Continue constructing the remaining parts following these same guidelines. Be meticulous in following the sequence, and make sure to document all the details about curves, loops, and faces as required. Always express the instructions in the context of the final shape that you’ve determined, and do not make any additional assumptions.</description>",

The Euler angles are set to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is set to [0.375, 0.0, 0.0099]. This will position the sketch plane correctly for the upcoming steps. The first face of the sketch contains a single loop, which in turn consists of three connected lines (line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, and line\\\\_3). Here are the details about these curves: - line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0551, 0.3165] - line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.0551, 0.3165], End Point [0.0, 0.3164] - line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.0, 0.3164], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This loop is closed and has three lines. Next, scale this 2D sketch by a factor of 0.3165 using the `sketch_scale` parameter specified. This will adjust the dimensions of the sketch according to the design requirements. Now, we need to transform the 2D sketch to 3D space. We'll be using the given Euler angles (-90.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector [0.375, 0.0, 0.0099] as input for the transformation. This will position the sketch surface according to the specified coordinate system, ready for the next steps.
