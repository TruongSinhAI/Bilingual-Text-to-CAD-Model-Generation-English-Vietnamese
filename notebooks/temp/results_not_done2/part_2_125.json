These discrepancies mean the description does not accurately reflect the CAD operations in the JSON.\\n</think>"

The sequence of lines forms a closed rectangular loop:\\n    - Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.0978, 0.0]\\n    - Line 2: [0.0978, 0.0] to [0.0978, 0.0978]\\n    - Line 3: [0.0978, 0.0978] to [0.0, 0.0978]\\n    - Line 4: [0.0, 0.0978] to [0.0, 0.0] (closes the loop)\\n    This is a geometrically sound rectangular sketch.\\n  - Extrusion: The `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, and `sketch_scale` values precisely match the JSON. The operation is correctly inferred as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation' for the first constructed part.\\n\\n- Overall Consistency: The cleaned description provides a complete and accurate representation of the CAD model defined in the JSON. All geometric and operational parameters are consistent. No corrections are necessary.\\n</think>"
