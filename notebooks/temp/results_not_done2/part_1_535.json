Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model with an extrusion depth of 0.0476 towards the normal and 0.0 depth opposite the normal. **Part 2: Construct a cylindrical object with a smaller cylindrical hole in the center.** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector of 0.0214, 0.0362, 0.0476. Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. Draw a circle with center at (0.0262, 0.0263) and radius of 0.0262. Create a new sketch on face 2 of the coordinate system. Draw a circle with center at (0.0262, 0.6512) and radius of 0.0262. Extrude the two circles in opposite directions to create a cylindrical object with a hole. The extrusion depth towards the normal should be 0.0 and the depth opposite the normal should be 0.127. Scale the sketch using a sketch scale of 0.6775. **Part 3: Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom.** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector of 0.0214, 0.3487, 0.0476. Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. Draw a circle with center at (0.0262, 0.0262) and radius of 0.0262. Extrude the circle in opposite directions to create a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. The extrusion depth towards the normal should be 0.0 and the depth opposite the normal should be 0.127. Scale the sketch using a sketch scale of 0.0525. The assembly consists of three parts. Part 1 is a long, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Part 2 is a cylindrical object with a smaller cylindrical hole in the center. Part 3 is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. The length, width, and height of the final shape are 0.75, 0.127, and 0.75 units, respectively. The length, width, and height of part 1 are 0.75, 0.75, and 0.0476 units, respectively. The length, width, and height of part 2 are 0.6775, 0.6775, and 0.127 units, respectively. The length, width, and height of part 3 are 0.0525, 0.0525, and 0.127 units, respectively. The coordinate system, sketch, and extrusion properties for each part should be used to generate a parametric CAD model. The final model should be consistent with the given description of the final shape in the CAD Assembly JSON. Follow the instructions as specified, without making any additional assumptions.</description>",
