The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, while the front and back faces are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The sides of the prism are straight and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Start by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0268, 0.0] Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system. Within the sketch, create a new face. On this face, create the following loop using lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.5625, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.5625, 0.0], End Point [0.5625, 0.75] - Line 3: Start Point [0.5625, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Close the loop and note that there are 4 lines in this loop.

Use a sketch scale factor of 0.75. The resulting part should be the bottom section of the prism. Repeat these steps to create the top section of the prism, making sure to adjust the dimensions and translation vector accordingly. The length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is approximately 0.0268 units, and the height is 0.75 units. After completing Part 1, continue with Part 2 and its instructions as provided in the CAD Assembly JSON. Remember to create a new coordinate system, sketch, and extrude for each new part, and to adjust the dimensions as needed based on the JSON data. When necessary, perform boolean operations to combine parts according to their natural language descriptions as provided, without using specific boolean operation terms. Provide clear, concise instructions for each step, and ensure the resulting CAD model matches the final shape and dimensions described in the JSON data.</description>",
