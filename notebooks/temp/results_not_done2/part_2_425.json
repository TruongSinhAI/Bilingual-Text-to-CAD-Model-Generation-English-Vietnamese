At this point, you should have a closed loop made up of four connected lines on the XY plane. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** Using the sketch scaling parameter `sketch_scale` (0.75), scale the 2D sketch. This will maintain the overall shape while changing the absolute dimensions. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch to a 3D sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (which were provided as part of the coordinate system) and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (also from the coordinate system). 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along its Z-axis, creating a 3D model. Use an extrusion depth of 0.75 units in the normal direction and 0 units in the opposite direction of the normal (i.e. only toward the positive Z-axis). **Parameters** - length: 0.75 - width: 0.75 - height: 0.75 Next, proceed to the instructions for the subsequent parts, described by the given CAD Assembly JSON.</description>",
