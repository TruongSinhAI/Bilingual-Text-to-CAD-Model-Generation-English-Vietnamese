The arc has a Start Point, Mid Point, and End Point, which implies a circular arc. Given the Start/End points are vertical and the Mid Point is at x=0, this forms half a circle (a D-shape). This is a valid sketch.- Part 3 Sketch validation:- The sketch is identical to Part 2, which is expected for a cut operation that uses the same profile.- Extrusion parameters and coordinate system parameters for all parts are directly extracted from the description and are consistent.- Operation for part 1 and part 2 matches the description.- Correction: For `part_3`, the description explicitly states \\\"Operation: CutFeatureOperation (remove material to create a hole)\\\". However, the provided JSON has \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\". This is a significant mismatch in the operation type. The JSON should be corrected to \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" for `part_3` to match the description.</think>"
