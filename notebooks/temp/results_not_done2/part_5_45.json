Make sure to adjust the coordinate system for each part before proceeding to the next steps. * The 2D sketches consist of circles, with the specified properties. The sketches are then scaled and transformed into 3D shapes through extrusion operations along the Z-axis. * For the final shape, a slight additional extrusion operation is applied to one side of the part to create the desired tapering on the top and bottom. * Both parts exhibit cylindrical symmetry; therefore, it is essential to pay close attention to the given dimensions in the parts description when drawing each 2D sketch. * Keep in mind that these natural language instructions are provided without making any assumptions. The instructions contain clear headings, section breaks, and ordinal numbers to distinguish between parts, sketches, curves, loops, and faces.
