Each line pair forms a rectangle with a slight curve along one side (the curved side of the prism). The curve is not explicitly defined in the JSON, but can be inferred from the arrangement of the lines. 6. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 7. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 8. Extrude the 2D sketch along the negative Z-direction by 0.0109 units to generate the 3D model. The final shape of the part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side.

Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 2. Draw the 2D sketch on the XY-plane of the new coordinate system. 3. The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1), and a loop (loop\\\\_1) on this face. We will now describe the loop in detail. 4. Loop\\\\_1 consists of the following curves: - 10 lines (line\\\\_1 to line\\\\_10) - The lines can be grouped into 4 pairs, each pair defining a side of the prism. - The start and end points of these lines are as follows: ```json line_1: [0.0, 0.6792], [0.0202, 0.0] line_2: [0.0202, 0.0], [0.064, 0.0] line_3: [0.064, 0.0], [0.0749, 0.0] line_4: [0.0749, 0.0], [0.1734, 0.0] line_5: [0.1734, 0.0], [0.1734, 0.0175] line_6: [0.1734, 0.0175], [0.0749, 0.0175] line_7: [0.0749, 0.0175], [0.0748, 0.6413] line_8: [0.0748, 0.6413], [0.175, 0.6915] line_9: [0.175, 0.6915], [0.1386, 0.75] line_10: [0.1386, 0.75], [0.0, 0.6792] ``` 5. Each line pair forms a rectangle with a slight curve along one side (the curved side of the prism). The curve is not explicitly defined in the JSON, but can be inferred from the arrangement of the lines. 6. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 7.
