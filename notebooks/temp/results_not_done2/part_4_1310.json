In such a JSON structure, it's typically implied that all sketches under that `sketch` object are on the primary plane (e.g., XY plane) defined by the parent coordinate system, unless explicit plane definitions or nested coordinate systems are provided for individual faces within the `sketch` block. The JSON does not provide such explicit plane definitions for Face 2.\\n  - Therefore, the description's instruction for Face 2 to be on the YZ plane is inconsistent with the likely interpretation of the JSON's structure, which implies all sketches are on the XY plane of the main coordinate system.\\n\\n-Correction: The description's specification of the YZ plane for Face 2 is a discrepancy with the JSON's implicit single sketch plane defined by the part's coordinate system. This leads to a mismatch, so the validation result is \\\"No\\\".\\n</think>"
