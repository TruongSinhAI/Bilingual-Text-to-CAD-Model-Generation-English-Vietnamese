Scale the sketch by 0.75 before extrusion. **Part 2: Construct a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center, slightly tapered at one end.** Change the coordinate system to match the new translation vector and apply the original rotation. **Sketch:** Draw a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. Create loop 1 on the sketch using 4 linear curves: - Line 1: Start Point (0, 0), End Point (0.75, 0) - Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0), End Point (0.75, 0.0273) - Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.0273), Start Point (0, 0.0273) - Line 4: Start Point (0, 0.0273), End Point (0, 0) The loop is closed automatically. **Extrusion:** Extrude the sketch, adding to the previous solid bodies with a depth of 0.0547 towards the normal and no opposite-normal depth. Scale the sketch by 0.75 before extrusion.</description><valid>No</valid><think>***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:part_1: (Flat Rectangular Shape)-coordinate_system:  --Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")  --Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")-sketch:  --face_1:    ---loop_1:      ----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")      ----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0273] (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")      ----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.0273], End [0.0, 0.0273] (Corrected from \"  \n  , \n  \" in description)      ----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.0273], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")-extrusion:  --extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0547 (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")  --extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")  --sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")  --operation: \"  \n  , \n  \" (Inferred as a new body)part_2: (Rectangular Prism with Cylindrical Hole)-coordinate_system:  --Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Inferred from \"  \n  , \n  \" and \"  \n  , \n  \")  --Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0273, 0.0] (Inferred from \"  \n  , \n  \" and \"  \n  , \n  \")-sketch:  --face_1:    ---loop_1:      ----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")      ----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0273] (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")      ----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.0273], End [0.0, 0.0273] (Corrected from \"  \n  , \n  \" in description)      ----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.0273], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")-extrusion:  --extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0547 (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")  --extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")  --sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from description: \"  \n  , \n  \")  --operation: \"  \n  , \n  \" (Inferred from \"  \n  , \n  \")  --Hole Feature: (Inferred from description \"  \n  , \n  \" but not present in JSON)***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:Part 1:  -Coordinate System: The Euler Angles and Translation Vector explicitly match the JSON.  -Sketch: The lines defining Loop 1 of Face 1 match the JSON. The description has a typo \"  \n  , \n  \" for Line 3's end point, but the coordinates (0, 0.0273) match the JSON's end point. The title mentions \"  \n  , \n  \", but the line definitions are straight and match the JSON, which does not show rounded corners. I will consider the explicit line definitions as the primary source for matching.  -Extrusion: Extrusion depth, opposite depth, and sketch scale match the JSON. The operation \"  \n  , \n  \" is appropriate for a new body.  -Conclusion for Part 1: Matches JSON.Part 2:  -Coordinate System: The description states \"  \n  , \n  \" and \"  \n  , \n  \" without providing explicit numerical values. The JSON has `Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]` and `Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0273, 0.0]`. While the \"  \n  , \n  \" might refer to Part 1's rotation, the \"  \n  , \n  \" is not explicitly given numerically in the description. This is a mismatch in specificity.  -Sketch: The lines defining Loop 1 of Face 1 match the JSON. Similar typo for Line 3.  -Extrusion: Extrusion depth, opposite depth, and sketch scale match the JSON. The operation \"  \n  , \n  \" matches \"  \n  , \n  \".  -Major Mismatch: The description for Part 2 explicitly mentions \"  \n  , \n  \" and \"  \n  , \n  \". The JSON for `part_2` *only* defines a rectangular sketch and an extrusion, with no other features that would create a cylindrical hole or use an intersect operation. This is a significant discrepancy.Result: The description does not match the JSON for Part 2 due to the lack of explicit coordinate system values and, critically, the described cylindrical hole feature being entirely absent from the JSON. Therefore, the validity is 'No'.</think>"
