This sketch forms a rectangular shape with triangular cutouts on two sides. Now scale the 2D sketch using the `sketch_scale` parameter of 0.75. Then extrude the 2D sketch along the normal by 0.2267 units. After that, extrude the same sketch -0.2267 units along the opposite direction of the normal. This step is a workaround since the 'extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal' parameter is not directly applicable without performing an extrusion opposite the normal. Complete the part with the given scaling and extrusion details: Extrusion * Extrude depth (towards normal): 0.2267 * Extrude depth (opposite normal): 0.0 * Sketch scale: 0.75 * Operation (Implicit): JoinFeatureOperation (add materials to the existing CAD model).
