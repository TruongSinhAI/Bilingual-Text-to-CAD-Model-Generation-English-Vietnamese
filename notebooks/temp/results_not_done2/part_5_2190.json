This will form the final shape: a cylindrical object with a smaller cylindrical hole in the center. Note that Part 3 is not explicitly joined with another part. This means it exists as a separate solid body, but does not interfere with the other parts. During the process, ensure the scales and dimensions match those provided in the JSON. The extrusion depths, Euler angles, translation vectors, and sketch scales determine the final dimensions of the shape. Always pay attention to the numerical values to craft an accurate CAD model. While creating the CAD model, bear in mind that additional details and assumptions might be required, depending on the specific CAD software.
