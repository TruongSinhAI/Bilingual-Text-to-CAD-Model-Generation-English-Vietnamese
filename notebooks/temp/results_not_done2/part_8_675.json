It does not explicitly restate the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` or `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`. However, given the context of \\\"joining\\\" and the expectation of creating a similar shape to be added, it's logical that the extrusion depths would be the same as Part 1, especially since the JSON confirms these values. This is an implicit match.\\n  -The operation \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" is explicitly stated in the description and matches the JSON.\\n\\n-Correction: The inferred data is accurate and consistent with the description and JSON. No corrections needed.\\n</think>"
