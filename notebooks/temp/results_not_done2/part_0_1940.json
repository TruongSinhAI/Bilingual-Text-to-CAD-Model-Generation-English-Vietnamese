All points and parameters match.--Result: Part 1 specifications are consistent with the JSON.-Check Part 1 extrusion parameters:-Extrusion depths (0.6293 normal, 0.0 opposite) and sketch scale (0.75) are explicitly stated in the description and match the JSON. The operation \"\n        ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n        ,\" is consistent with creating the base prism.--Result: Part 1 extrusion parameters are correct.-Check Part 2 coordinate system and sketch:-Coordinate system values [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] for Euler angles and [0.0508, 0.3738, 0.0311] for translation vector match the description.-Sketch defines two faces: `face_1` with a circle loop, and `face_2` with a rectangle loop. All points, centers, and radii match the description. The rectangle in `face_2` forms a closed loop: [0.333, 0.0263] -> [0.5465, 0.0263] -> [0.5465, 0.0616] -> [0.333, 0.0616] -> [0.333, 0.0263].--Result: Part 2 sketch and coordinate system are consistent with the JSON.-Check Part 2 extrusion parameters:-Extrusion depths (0.2937 normal, 0.2937 opposite) and sketch scale (0.5465) are explicitly stated and match the JSON. The operation \"\n        ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"\n        ,\" is appropriate given the description of creating a \"\n        ,\"cylindrical hole running through its center\"\n        ,\" via extrusion in both directions.--Result: Part 2 extrusion parameters are correct.Correction: No corrections needed. The inferred data accurately reflects the provided JSON and cleaned description.</think>"
