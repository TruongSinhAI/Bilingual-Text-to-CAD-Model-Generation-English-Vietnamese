Scale this 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal by a depth of 0.0066 to create the prism base. The resulting prism should have a length and width of approximately 0.75 units, and a height of 0.0066 units. **Construct the cylindrical base and top** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 90.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0133. For the sketch, draw a circle on face 1 of the coordinate system. This circle consists of a center point at (0.0, 0.0) and a radius of 1.0 units. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal by a depth of 0.0066 to create the cylindrical base. The resulting cylinder should have a diameter of approximately 2.0 units and a height of 0.0066 units. Repeat these steps for the cylindrical top, but translate the coordinate system along the normal by a distance of 0.0133 + 0.0066 = 0.02 units. The resulting cylinder should again have a diameter of approximately 2.0 units and a height of 0.0066 units. **Combine the prism, cylindrical base, and cylindrical top** Combine the prism base, cylindrical base, and cylindrical top using the join boolean operation. The resulting shape should resemble a simple, rectangular prism with a cylindrical base and top, both with a diameter of 2.0 units and a height of 4.0 units (2 * (0.0133 + 0.0066)).</description>",

Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin (0,0,0). Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] to rotate the coordinate system, and set the translation vector to [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] to position it correctly. Now, proceed to creation of the 2D sketch. Set the sketch plane to be perpendicular to the z-axis. Draw a rectangle by creating four lines. The first line starts at (0.0, 0.0) and ends at (0.375, 0.0). The second line starts at (0.375, 0.0) and ends at (0.375, 0.375). The third line starts at (0.375, 0.375) and ends at (0.0, 0.375). The fourth line starts at (0.0, 0.375) and ends at (0.0, 0.0). Next, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.375. Finally, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by setting the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.75 units and the extrude depth opposite of normal to 0.0 units. The sketch scale remains 0.375, and the operation is 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'. <part\\\\_2> Create a three-dimensional model of a rectangular prism with a square base and a rectangular top. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the same rotation as part\\\\_1. Place it at the same position by setting the translation vector to [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. Create a new 2D sketch on the plane perpendicular to the z-axis. Draw a larger rectangle compared to part\\\\_1 with four lines. The first line starts at (0.0, 0.0) and ends at (0.375, 0.0). The second line starts at (0.375, 0.0) and ends at (0.375, 0.375). The third line starts at (0.375, 0.375) and ends at (0.0, 0.375). The fourth line starts at (0.0, 0.375) and ends at (0.0, 0.0). Add another rectangle below the first one. The second rectangle will share the same bottom left corner point (0.0, 0.0) as the first one. The rectangle will have the following four points on the corners: (0.375, 0.375), (0.375, 0.75), (0.0, 0.75), (0.0, 0.375). Next, create a third rectangle on the right side of the previous rectangles. Again, share the bottom left corner with the first rectangle. Have the four points on corners as (0.375, 0.0), (0.75, 0.0), (0.75, 0.375), (0.375, 0.375). Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by setting the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.375 units and the extrude depth opposite of normal to 0.0 units. The sketch scale remains 0.75, and the operation is 'JoinFeatureOperation'. Note: Ensure the joined part is merged with part\\\\_1 during the CAD modeling process.</description>",
