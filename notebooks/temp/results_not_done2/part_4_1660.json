Set the Euler angles to `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` degrees and the translation vector to `[0.0, 0.0071, 0.0]`. This will establish the reference frame for the 2D sketch. **Step 2: 2D sketch** On the XY plane of the established coordinate system, create a new 2D sketch. **Step 3: Faces, curves, and loops** In the sketch, perform the following actions: 1. Create the first face (face_1) with the following loop (loop_1): - Begin by creating line_1 from point (0.0, 0.0761) to point (0.0155, 0.009). - Create line_2 from point (0.0155, 0.009) to point (0.75, 0.0). - Create line_3 from point (0.75, 0.0) to point (0.7318, 0.1128). - Create line_4 from point (0.7318, 0.1128) to point (0.6929, 0.1292). - Close the loop by creating line_5 from point (0.6929, 0.1292) back to point (0.0, 0.0761).

Since there is no opposite normal extrusion specified, no action is required in the opposite direction. As extruding gives a 3D body, you don't need to perform any boolean operations for this shape.
