Each part is constructed using a set of well-defined steps, following the sequence of creating the coordinate system, drawing a 2D sketch, scaling, and extruding to create the 3D model. The shapes, dimensions, and operations for each part and the overall assembly are well-described and detailed, enabling a junior CAD designer to generate accurate models.</description>",
