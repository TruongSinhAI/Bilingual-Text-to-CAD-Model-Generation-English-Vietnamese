    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism Face 1 Begin by creating a new coordinate system for the base of the prism. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.5, 0.0]. This will position the base of the prism 0.5 units above the X-Y plane. Create a face for the base of the prism. On the face, create a loop (loop\\\\_1) for the perimeter of the base. Within loop\\\\_1, create 5 line segments (line\\\\_1 through line\\\\_5) to define the shape of the base. The lines should be defined by the following start and end points, measured in units along the X and Y axes: * line\\\\_1: [0.0, 0.0], [0.5, 0.0] * line\\\\_2: [0.5, 0.0], [0.5, 0.25] * line\\\\_3: [0.5, 0.25], [0.25, 0.625] * line\\\\_4: [0.25, 0.625], [0.0, 0.625] * line\\\\_5: [0.0, 0.625], [0.0, 0.0] Face 2 Create a new face (face\\\\_2) for the side of the prism. On face\\\\_2, create a loop (loop\\\\_1) for the perimeter of the side. Within loop\\\\_1, create 4 line segments (line\\\\_1 through line\\\\_4) to define the shape of the side. The lines should be defined by the following start and end points, measured in units along the X and Y axes: * line\\\\_1: [0.5, 0.0], [0.75, 0.0] * line\\\\_2: [0.75, 0.0], [0.75, 0.25] * line\\\\_3: [0.75, 0.25], [0.5, 0.25] * line\\\\_4: [0.5, 0.25], [0.5, 0.0] Next, scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. Extrude the base sketch by 0.5 units in the direction of the Z axis (normal). This will result in a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, a curved side, and a straight side. The height of the prism is 0.75 units, the length is 0.75 units, and the width is 0.5 units.</description>",
