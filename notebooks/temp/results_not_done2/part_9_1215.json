Close the loop. **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.7195. **Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the same coordinate system. **Step 5: Extrude the 3D Sketch** 1. Extrude the 3D sketch towards the positive Z-direction by 0.0327 units. 2. Extrude the 3D sketch towards the negative Z-direction by 0 units. 3. Set the operation to create a new solid body. **Step 6: Create a cylindrical hole** Create a cylindrical hole through the prism using a separate operation. This will involve creating a new coordinate system, drawing a 2D sketch of the circle, scaling, transforming into a 3D Sketch, and extruding to create the hole. **Step 7: Finalize the CAD Part** The final part should be a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole, with the following dimensions: * Length: 0.7195 units * Width: 0.7195 units * Height: 0.0327 units **Part 2 and beyond: Additional Instructions** Further parts will be constructed in a similar manner, with a new coordinate system and set of operations. Ensure that each part is correctly positioned and oriented before beginning the next one. The shape, dimensions, and details of each part will be specified in the CAD Assembly JSON, and should be followed carefully to ensure an accurate final assembly.</description>",
