Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.125 to generate the 3D model. The final shape of Part 1 will be a three-dimensional, geometric shape with a pointed tip and a flat base, resembling a pyramid.
