The prism is slightly tapered towards the top. 1. **Create a new coordinate system** with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 2. **Draw a 2D sketch** on a plane defined by the coordinate system. 2.1. **Create the bottom face of the prism** by drawing a loop with the following lines: - **Line 1**: Start Point [0.0, 0.1154], End Point [0.3462, 0.1154] - **Line 2**: Start Point [0.3462, 0.1154], End Point [0.3462, 0.1731] - **Line 3**: Start Point [0.3462, 0.1731], End Point [0.0, 0.1731] - **Line 4**: Start Point [0.0, 0.1731], End Point [0.0, 0.1154] 2.2. **Create the vertical face of the prism** by drawing a loop with the following lines: - **Line 1**: Start Point [0.3462, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - **Line 2**: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.2885] - **Line 3**: Start Point [0.75, 0.2885], End Point [0.3462, 0.2885] - **Line 4**: Start Point [0.3462, 0.2885], End Point [0.3462, 0.1731] - **Line 5**: Start Point [0.3462, 0.1731], End Point [0.3462, 0.1154] - **Line 6**: Start Point [0.3462, 0.1154], End Point [0.3462, 0.0] 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** using a scaling factor of 0.75. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch** using euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch** to create the 3D model of the prism. - Extrude depth towards the normal: 0.0577 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 The dimensions of this prism are as follows: - Height: 0.0577 m - Width: 0.75 m - Length: 0.75 m (Note: Since the CAD assembly JSON does not provide curves, loops, and faces information, the given instructions are based on the shape description provided and do not include specific details related to the curves, loops, and faces.)</description>",
