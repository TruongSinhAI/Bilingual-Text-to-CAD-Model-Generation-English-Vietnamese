This sketch will be a rectangle with a curved side. Begin by drawing line 1 starting at [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.0]. Then, draw line 2 starting at [0.75, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.2578].

You should now have a rectangle outlined in four lines. Now, we will add a curve to one side of the rectangle. Since the final shape description mentions a curved side, we will replace line 2 with an arc that has the same start and end points. Draw an arc that starts at [0.75, 0.0], ends at [0.75, 0.2578], and has its midpoint at approximately [0.75, 0.13]. This will create a curve on the right side of the rectangle. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch scaling parameter. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use an extrude depth towards the normal of 0.0352 units, and an extrude depth opposite the normal of 0 units. **Part 2: Construct a three-dimensional geometric shape with a rectangular base and a triangular top.** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: Euler angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Translation vector: [0.3164, 0.1113, 0.0352] Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system.
