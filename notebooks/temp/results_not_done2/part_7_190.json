Create a circle centered at point (0.125, 0.1953) with a radius of 0.0625. 6. Create a loop connecting the arc; no other lines or curves are needed. 7. Create a loop with a line from point (0.3281, 0.1484) to point (0.4219, 0.1484). 8. Continue the loop with a line from point (0.4219, 0.1484) to point (0.4219, 0.2422). 9. Again, draw a line from point (0.4219, 0.2422) to point (0.3281, 0.2422) and close the loop. 10. Create the final loop with a line from point (0.5, 0.0871) to point (0.625, 0.0871). 11. Complete the loop with a line from point (0.625, 0.0871) to point (0.5625, 0.1953). 12. Finish the loop by drawing a line from point (0.5625, 0.1953) to point (0.5, 0.0871). Now we will create face_2: **Face 2:** 1. Create a loop and draw a circle centered at point (0.125, 0.1953) with a radius of 0.0625. Next, we will extrude the sketch: * Sketch Scale: 0.75 * Extrusion Depth (towards normal): 0.1 * Extrusion Depth (opposite normal): 0 Part 2: Cylindrical object with a reflective surface and a slightly tapered top and bottom Start by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0625, 0.1328, 0.1562] Now, create the 2D sketch for the second part on face_1. **Face 1:** 1. Create a circle centered at point (0.0625, 0.0625) with a radius of 0.0625.
