Loop 1: * line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.325, 0.0] * line_2: Start Point [0.325, 0.0], End Point [0.325, 0.075] * line_3: Start Point [0.325, 0.075], End Point [0.075, 0.075] * line_4: Start Point [0.075, 0.075], End Point [0.075, 0.3875] * line_5: Start Point [0.075, 0.3875], End Point [0.05, 0.3875] * line_6: Start Point [0.05, 0.3875], End Point [0.05, 0.3625] * line_7: Start Point [0.05, 0.3625], End Point [0.025, 0.3625] * line_8: Start Point [0.025, 0.3625], End Point [0.025, 0.3875] * line_9: Start Point [0.025, 0.3875], End Point [0.0, 0.3875] * line_10: Start Point [0.0, 0.3875], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Extrusion Extrude the sketch in both directions: 1. Towards normal: 0.1875 2. Opposite normal: 0.1875 3.
