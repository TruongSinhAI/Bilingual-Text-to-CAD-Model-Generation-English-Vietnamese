    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top and Bottom** The first part is a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. To create this part, follow these steps: **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation or translation. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch for the base of the prism** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw a line from (0, 0) to (0.75, 0). This line is the first curve of the sketch and defines the left edge of the prism's base. Draw a line from (0.75, 0) to (0.75, 0.1425). This line is the second curve of the sketch and defines the bottom edge of the prism's base. Draw a line from (0.75, 0.1425) to (0.731, 0.1425). This line is the third curve of the sketch and defines the right edge of the tapered top of the prism. Draw an arc from (0.731, 0.1425) to (0.642, 0.1283) with its midpoint at approximately (0.6859, 0.1389). This arc is the fourth curve of the sketch and defines the top right corner of the tapered top. Draw an arc from (0.642, 0.1283) to (0.464, 0.1283) with its midpoint at approximately (0.553, 0.114). This arc is the fifth curve of the sketch and defines the top left corner of the tapered top. Draw a line from (0.464, 0.1283) to (0.286, 0.1283). This line is the sixth curve of the sketch. Draw an arc from (0.286, 0.1283) to (0.108, 0.1283) with its midpoint at approximately (0.197, 0.114). This arc is the seventh curve of the sketch and defines the left edge of the tapered bottom of the prism. Draw a line from (0.108, 0.1283) to (0.019, 0.1425). This line is the eighth curve of the sketch. Draw a line from (0.019, 0.1425) to (0.0, 0.1425). This line is the ninth curve of the sketch and defines the right edge of the tapered bottom of the prism. Draw a line from (0.0, 0.1425) to (0.0, 0.0). This line is the tenth curve of the sketch and connects the left edge of the tapered bottom to the left edge of the prism's base. Close the loop by connecting the last point back to the first point. **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 to adjust the size of the prism. **Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch into 3D** Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by a distance of 0.3801 to create the 3D shape. Use the Euler angles provided in the coordinate system as needed to ensure the correct orientation. **Step 5: Complete the part** The final shape should be a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. With a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.3801 units.</description>",
