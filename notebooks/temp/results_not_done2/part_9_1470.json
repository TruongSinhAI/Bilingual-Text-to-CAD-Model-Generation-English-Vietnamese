Draw a rectangle defined by the following lines: - Line 1: Starting from (0.0, 0.0) and ending at (0.75, 0.0) - Line 2: Starting from (0.75, 0.0) and ending at (0.75, 0.75) - Line 3: Starting from (0.75, 0.75) and ending at (0.0, 0.75) - Line 4: Starting from (0.0, 0.75) and ending at (0.0, 0.0) 3. Since the shape is a prism, it has a flat top and bottom. To achieve this, add a circle centered at (0.0105, 0.0105) and another circle centered at (0.0105, 0.7395) with a radius of 0.0058 each.

Draw an arc with a start point of (0.0882, 0.0), a mid point of (0.1399, 0.1248), and an end point of (0.2647, 0.1765). 3. Draw a line from points (0.2647, 0.1765) to (0.75, 0.1765). 4.

Extrude the 3D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.75 units. Set the `sketch_scale` property to 0.75 and set the `operation` property to `NewBodyFeatureOperation`. Describing the Intermediate Part The intermediate part is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The length and width of the prism are approximately 0.75 units, and the height is 0.75 units. The shape is generated by creating a closed 2D sketch containing one face with one loop, and the loop is formed by connecting seven curves (six lines and one arc). The sketch is then scaled and transformed into a 3D prism with a uniform height and tapered ends.</description>",
