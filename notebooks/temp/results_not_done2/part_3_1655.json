    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: (-90.0, 0.0, -90.0) - Translation Vector: (0.2206, 0.0, 0.0) Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch for part 1 Using the newly created coordinate system, draw a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Face 1 Loop 1 For this loop, we need to construct 10 lines as follows: - Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.3466, 0.0) - Line 2: Start Point (0.3466, 0.0), End Point (0.3785, 0.5075) - Line 3: Start Point (0.3785, 0.5075), End Point (0.1647, 0.5209) - Line 4: Start Point (0.1647, 0.5209), End Point (0.1789, 0.748) - Line 5: Start Point (0.1789, 0.748), End Point (0.0271, 0.75) - Line 6: Start Point (0.0271, 0.75), End Point (0.0271, 0.7151) - Line 7: Start Point (0.0271, 0.7151), End Point (0.1072, 0.7151) - Line 8: Start Point (0.1072, 0.7151), End Point (0.0682, 0.0555) - Line 9: Start Point (0.0682, 0.0555), End Point (0.0, 0.0595) - Line 10: Start Point (0.0, 0.0595), End Point (0.0, 0.0) After drawing the curve, you should have a single loop in your 2D sketch. Ensure that this loop is closed. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch using the `sketch_scale` parameter of 0.75. Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch by the specified `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0) and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.2206). Based on the `description` provided in the JSON: - The prism has a length of 0.2206 - The width is 0.75 - The height is 0.75. Continue this process for the remaining parts in the CAD Assembly JSON, ensuring to label each part properly and provide detailed instructions as described in this example.</description>",
