Set the euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.75, 0.0). Create the first face of the sketch. On this face, draw a circle with a center point at (0.2775, 0.2775) and a radius of 0.2775. This completes loop 1 of face 1. Create a second face of the sketch. On this face, draw a circle with a center point at (0.2775, 0.2775) and a radius of 0.2325. This completes loop 2 of face 1. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.555. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system defined earlier. Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.75 in the direction of the normal and a depth of 0 in the opposite direction. The resulting CAD part should have the following dimensions: - Length: 0.555 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.555 The final shape is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. It has a smooth surface and appears to be a solid, three-dimensional shape. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. **Part 2 and beyond:** (Assuming additional parts are defined in the `parts` key of the CAD assembly JSON) For each part, follow the same process as outlined above for Part 1. Be sure to use the correct coordinate system, sketch, and extrusion parameters as defined in the CAD assembly JSON. For each part, construct the 2D sketch by drawing the required curves, loops, and faces as specified. Make sure to follow any constraints specified in the CAD assembly JSON. After constructing the 2D sketch for each part, scale it using the `sketch_scale` parameter defined in the extrusion key. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system key. Extrude the 2D sketch towards the normal by the depth defined in the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` key and towards the opposite direction by the depth defined in the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` key. The resulting CAD parts should have the dimensions and shapes described in the `description` key of the CAD assembly JSON. Repeat the above process for each part in the CAD assembly JSON. The final CAD model will be the combination of all the intermediate parts. Note that the `operation` key in the extrusion key defines how the current part is integrated with preceding CAD models. You can use the natural language descriptions listed in the instructions to understand how to integrate each part with the preceding parts. However, do not explicitly use the boolean operation terms while generating the CAD model.</description>",
