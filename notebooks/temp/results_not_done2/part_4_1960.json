    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]. This will establish the orientation and position for the first part. Sketch: Face 1 Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw four lines as follows: 1. Line 1: Starting from point [0.0, 0.0] and ending at point [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Line 2: Starting from point [0.75, 0.0] and ending at point [0.75, 0.75]. 3. Line 3: Starting from point [0.75, 0.75] and ending at point [0.0, 0.75]. 4. Line 4: Starting from point [0.0, 0.75] and ending at point [0.0, 0.0]. Close the loop by connecting Line 1 and Line 4. This will create a rectangle with a width of 0.75 units and a height of 0.75 units. Next, create a second loop on the same face (Face 1) using the following steps: Crete a circle at the center point [0.375, 0.375] with a radius of 0.3 units. This completes the second loop, representing the cylindrical hole through the prism. Extrusion: Now, set the sketch scale to 0.75. Choose to extrude the sketch symmetrically in both directions (towards and opposite the normal vector). Set the 'extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal' value to 0.1875 and the 'extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal' value to 0.1875. This will result in a prism block with a height of 0.375 units (0.1875 x 2, due to symmetric extrusion). The final prism size will be approximately 3 units in length (0.75 x 4, accounting for extrusion), 2 units in width (accounting for the rectangle), and 1 unit in height (the extrusion depth). Part 2: Cylindrical object with flat top and bottom, slightly tapered middle section Create a new coordinate system with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and translation vector [0.075, 0.375, 0.075]. This will establish the orientation and position for the second part. Sketch: Face 1 Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw a circle with center point [0.3, 0.3] and radius 0.3 units. Extrusion: Set the sketch scale to 0.6. Choose to extrude the sketch symmetrically in both directions (towards and opposite the normal vector). Set the 'extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal' and 'extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal' values to 0.0375 each. This will result in a cylinder-like shape with height of 0.075 units (0.0375 x 2, due to symmetric extrusion). The final height will be 0.6 units (0.0375 x 2 + 0.075, accounting for the base). The width and length will be determined by the circular shape (0.6 units after scaling). The form will resemble a slightly tapered cylinder with a flat top and bottom.</description>",
