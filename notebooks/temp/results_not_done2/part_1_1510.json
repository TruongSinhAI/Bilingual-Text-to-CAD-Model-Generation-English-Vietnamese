Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch. For the extrusion step, extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.5 units towards the normal and 0.0 units in the opposite direction. Part 2 Instructions Begin by positioning the new coordinate system: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.5, 0.25] Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system, with a single face (face_1) containing four lines: - Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0], End Point = [0.7509, 0.3773] - Line 3: Start Point = [0.7509, 0.3773], End Point = [0.0, 0.3773] - Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.3773], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Close the loop to form a quadrilateral face. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.7509. Extrude the sketch by 0.25 units towards the normal and 0.0 units in the opposite direction.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description outlines two parts, \" ,\"part_1\",\" and \" ,\"part_2\",\".\\n\\npart_1:\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From \" ,\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\" ,\")\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.5, 0.0] (From \" ,\"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.5, 0.0]\" ,\")\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1:\\n    - loop_1:\\n      - line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (As described)\\n      - line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.625] (As described)\\n      - line_3: Start [0.75, 0.625], End [0.0, 0.625] (As described)\\n      - line_4: Start [0.0, 0.625], End [0.0, 0.0] (As described)\\n- extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.5 (From \" ,\"extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.5 units towards the normal\" ,\")\\n  - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (From \" ,\"0.0 units in the opposite direction\" ,\")\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.75 (From \" ,\"Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch\" ,\")\\n  - operation: \" ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\",\" (Inferred from creating a new part)\\n\\npart_2:\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From \" ,\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\" ,\")\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.5, 0.25] (From \" ,\"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.5, 0.25]\" ,\")\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1:\\n    - loop_1:\\n      - line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (As described)\\n      - line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.7509, 0.3773] (As described)\\n      - line_3: Start [0.7509, 0.3773], End [0.0, 0.3773] (As described)\\n      - line_4: Start [0.0, 0.3773], End [0.0, 0.0] (As described)\\n- extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.25 (From \" ,\"Extrude the sketch by 0.25 units towards the normal\" ,\")\\n  - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (From \" ,\"0.0 units in the opposite direction\" ,\")\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.7509 (From \" ,\"Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.7509\" ,\")\\n  - operation: \" ,\"CutFeatureOperation\",\" (Inferred from \" ,\"cutting away material from the top of the first part\" ,\")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n- Part 1:\\n  - Coordinate System: Euler angles and translation vector values match the JSON.\\n  - Sketch Geometry: All four lines in loop_1 are accurately represented with their start and end points, forming a closed quadrilateral shape, matching the JSON.\\n  - Extrusion: The extrusion depth (0.5), opposite depth (0.0), and sketch scale (0.75) are correctly extracted and match the JSON.
