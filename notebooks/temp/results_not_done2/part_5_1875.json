This will serve as the reference for the CAD model. **Step 2: Create the base face of the bracket** Draw the first face of the bracket as a rectangle, with the following lines: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.1287, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.1287, 0.0], End Point [0.1287, 0.2264] * Line 3: Start Point [0.1287, 0.2264], End Point [0.1287, 0.5236] * Line 4: Start Point [0.1287, 0.5236], End Point [0.0, 0.5236] * Line 5: Start Point [0.0, 0.5236], End Point [0.0, 0.0] **Step 3: Add the top loops to the base face** Add two circular loops to the face, each with a radius of 0.0291, at the following coordinates: * Loop 1: Center [0.0643, 0.193] * Loop 2: Center [0.0643, 0.557] **Step 4: Scale the 2D Sketch** Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75. **Step 5: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch, using euler angles and a translation vector. In this case, no transformations are necessary as the euler angles are all 0.0 and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 6: Extrude the 3D Sketch** Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the final CAD model with the following parameters: * Extrude a depth of 0.193 towards the normal. * Extrude a depth of 0.0 in the opposite direction. The final shape will be a rectangular metal bracket with the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.193</description>",
