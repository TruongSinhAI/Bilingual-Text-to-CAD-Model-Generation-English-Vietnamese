Generate the Sketch Create the sketch for part 1 on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch contains one face (face_1) with one loop (loop_1). Loop_1 contains 8 line segments: 1. line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.125, 0.0] 2. line_2: Start Point [0.125, 0.0], End Point [0.125, 0.25] 3. line_3: Start Point [0.125, 0.25], End Point [0.375, 0.25] 4. line_4: Start Point [0.375, 0.25], End Point [0.375, 0.0] 5. line_5: Start Point [0.375, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] 6. line_6: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.75] 7. line_7: Start Point [0.75, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] 8. line_8: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Extrude the Sketch Extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.0062 towards the normal and no depth in the opposite direction of the normal. Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch during the extrusion process. This will create the final shape for part 1, which is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one side, with a length of approximately 0.75, a width of 0.0062, and a height of approximately 0.75.
