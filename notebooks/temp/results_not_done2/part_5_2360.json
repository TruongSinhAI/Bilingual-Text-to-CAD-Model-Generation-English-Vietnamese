Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.5, 0.0]. This will position the sketch for the first part of the assembly. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system. Start by drawing a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0]. This forms the bottom edge of the prism. Continue by drawing a line from point [0.75, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.625]. This forms the left edge of the prism. Next, draw a line from point [0.75, 0.625] to point [0.0434, 0.6308]. This forms the back edge of the prism. Then, draw a line from point [0.0434, 0.6308] to point [0.0, 0.6308]. This forms the top edge of the prism. Finally, connect the top edge to the starting point by drawing a line from point [0.0, 0.6308] to point [0.0, 0.0]. This completes the sketch for the first part, which is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D by applying the 3D rotation defined by the Euler angles and the translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth of 0.5 towards the normal and no extrusion in the opposite direction. The sketch scale factor is 0.75. This completes the first part of the CAD assembly. The length of this part is 0.75, the width is 0.5, and the height is 0.75. The final shape of this part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.
