Due to the absence of a description for `part_1.sketch.face_2`, the description does not perfectly match the JSON.\\n</think>"

Start by creating a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. 2. Construct the following lines in sequence: - Line 1: [0.0, 0.75] to [0.6262, 0.75] - Line 2: [0.6262, 0.75] to [0.67, 0.75] - Line 3: [0.67, 0.75] to [0.6721, 0.6279] - Line 4: [0.6721, 0.6279] to [0.4501, 0.624] - Line 5: [0.4501, 0.624] to [0.4501, 0.0] - Line 6: [0.4501, 0.0] to [0.3372, 0.0] - Line 7: [0.3372, 0.0] to [0.2242, 0.0] - Line 8: [0.2242, 0.0] to [0.2242, 0.6279] - Line 9: [0.2242, 0.6279] to [0.0022, 0.624] - Line 10: [0.0022, 0.624] to [0.0, 0.75] You have now created 1 loop with 10 lines. Note that each line has a start point and an end point. Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Perform a 3D transform (rotation and translation) of the 2D sketch using the following properties: - Euler Angles from the coordinate system (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) - Translation Vector from the coordinate system (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction with the following properties: - Extrude depth towards the normal: 0.3397 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 - Scaling parameter: 0.75 - Operation: Creation of a new solid body (in natural language) Part 1 Description The final shape consists of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom and a slightly tapered middle section. The dimensions are as follows:: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.3397</description>",
