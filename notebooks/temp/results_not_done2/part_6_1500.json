This part is a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Creating the coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system using the given Euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: (-90.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) Generating the 2D sketch With the coordinate system in place, draw the 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Use the following information for the sketch: The sketch, named 'face\\\\_1', contains one loop (loop\\\\_1) with four lines: * Line 1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.0405, 0.0) * Line 2: (0.0405, 0.0) to (0.0405, 0.75) * Line 3: (0.0405, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75) * Line 4: (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.0) Scaling the 2D sketch Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the drawn 2D sketch. Transforming the scaled sketch into 3D Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector that we defined earlier for the coordinate system. Since this part is a prism with flat top and bottom, we don't need any further transformation. Extruding the 2D sketch Extrude the sketch vertically by providing an extrusion depth '0.0076' towards the normal and '0.0' opposite the normal. This extrusion depth is derived from the length property in the provided JSON. With these steps, you should be able to construct an accurate CAD model for <part\\\\_1>, which has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.0076 m * Width: 0.75 m * Height: 0.75 m Only the instructions for the provided JSON have been given; no assumptions have been made in addition to the provided information.</description>",
