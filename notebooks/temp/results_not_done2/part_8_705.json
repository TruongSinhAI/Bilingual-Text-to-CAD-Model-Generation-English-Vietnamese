    "prompt": "<description>**CAD Model Generation Instructions** The final shape to be constructed is a cylindrical object with a tapered end, resembling a stylized hammer or mallet. The cylinder is wider at the bottom and narrows towards the top, which is pointed. The object is centered and appears to be floating in space. This will be achieved through the construction of three intermediate parts. **Part 1** Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered top and a flat bottom. The top is slightly wider than the bottom. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.4181]. 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 3. Create a circle with center at [0.1659, 0.1659] and radius of 0.1659. 4. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.3319. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. 6. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.3319 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal to create the 3D model. **Part 2** Construct a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. It has a smooth surface and appears to be made of a reflective material. The object is centered and occupies a significant portion of the image. 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector of [0.1228, 0.1228, 0.4181]. 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 3. Create a circle with center at [0.0431, 0.0431] and radius of 0.0431. 4. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.0863. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. 6. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.3319 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal to create the 3D model. 7. Join the current part with the previous part using the \"JoinFeatureOperation\" operation. **Part 3** Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. The top is slightly wider than the bottom. The object has a smooth surface and appears to be made of a reflective material. 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 180.0] and translation vector of [0.1229, 0.209, 0.0863]. 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 3. Create a circle with center at [0.043, 0.043] and radius of 0.043. 4. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.0861. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. 6. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.0863 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal to create the 3D model. 7.
