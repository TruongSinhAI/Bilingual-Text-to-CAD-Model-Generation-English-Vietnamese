    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section.** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1 at (0.21, 0.21, 0.04). The euler angles are (0, 0, 0). Create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Start by drawing a circle with a center at (0.165, 0.165) and a radius of 0.165. Proceed to draw line 1 from (0.1275, 0.165) to (0.1462, 0.1325). Draw line 2 from (0.1462, 0.1325) to (0.1838, 0.1325). Draw line 3 from (0.1838, 0.1325) to (0.2025, 0.165). Draw line 4 from (0.2025, 0.165) to (0.1838, 0.1975). Draw line 5 from (0.1838, 0.1975) to (0.1462, 0.1975). Complete the loop by drawing line 6 from (0.1462, 0.1975) to (0.1275, 0.165). Close the loop. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.33. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D by applying the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the normal by 0.22 units and opposite normal by 0 units to create a 3D model. This completes part 1 with a length, width, and height of approximately 0.33, 0.33, and 0.22 units respectively. **Part 2: Cylindrical object with a central hole.** Create a new coordinate system for part 2 at (0, 0, 0.04). The euler angles are (0, 0, 0). Create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw circle 1 with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. Create circle 2, nested within circle 1, with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.165. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D by applying the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the normal by 0.26 units and opposite normal by 0 units to create a 3D model. This results in the creation of a new solid body and adds material to it. The length, width, and height of part 2 are approximately 0.75, 0.75, and 0.26 units respectively. **Part 3: Cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a circular hole in the center.** Create a new coordinate system for part 3 at (0, 0, 0.04). The euler angles are (0, 0, 0). Create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw circle 1 with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. Create circle 2, nested within circle 1, with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.165. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D by applying the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the normal by 0 units and opposite normal by 0.04 units to create a 3D model. This results in the creation of a new solid body and adds material to it.
