Step 7: Extrude the 2D sketch to create a 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.1295 units, creating a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered shape, narrowing towards the top. Step 8: Document the dimensions The dimensions of the intermediate part are as follows: - Base length: ~0.75 units - Base width: ~0.13 units - Height: ~0.13 units The final shape is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a slightly tapered shape, narrowing towards the top.
