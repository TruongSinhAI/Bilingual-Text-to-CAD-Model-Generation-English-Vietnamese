Within this sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and follow these instructions for drawing lines and loops: *Loop 1* - Line 1: [0.0, 0.7055], [0.4932, 0.0] - Line 2: [0.4932, 0.0], [0.5243, 0.0] - Line 3: [0.5243, 0.0], [0.5243, 0.0445] - Line 4: [0.5243, 0.0445], [0.0311, 0.75] - Line 5: [0.0311, 0.75], [0.0, 0.75] - Line 6: [0.0, 0.75], [0.0, 0.7055] **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by the sketch\\\\_scale factor, which is 0.75 in this case. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis using the following parameters: - Extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal: 0.0 - Extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal: 0.0218 After completing these steps, you will have generated a 3D model for this part of the assembly. The part has the following dimension details: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.0218 - Height: 0.75</description>",
