Apply Scale and Rotate the Sketch Scale the sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75, and rotate it using the euler angles defined in the coordinate system. The scaling should be applied to the entire sketch, not just individual curves. Extrude the Sketch Extrude the sketch along its normal direction by 0.0476 units. The resulting 3D shape will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides of the prism are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height (0.0476 x 0.75 x 2). This is the first intermediate part of the final shape. The operation to be used for integrating this part with preceding CAD models is \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" which means creating a new solid body.
