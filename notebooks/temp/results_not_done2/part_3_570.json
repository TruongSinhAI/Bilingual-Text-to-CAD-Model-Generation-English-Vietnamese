Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles (-90, 0, 0) and translation vector (0, 0.75, 0). **Face 1:** Create the first face of the prism by constructing a loop with twelve line segments. The lines are defined by the following start and end points: 1. (0, 0.078) to (0.1155, 0.078) 2. (0.1155, 0.078) to (0.1155, 0.0) 3. (0.1155, 0.0) to (0.2355, 0.0) 4.

(0.0, 0.126) to (0.0, 0.078) **Face 2:** Create the second face of the prism by constructing a loop with the same line segments as Face 1. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.75 units. Part 2: Cylindrical Hole Construct a cylindrical hole on one of the prism's faces. Start by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles (0, 0, 0) and translation vector (0.0957, 0.165, 0.1752). Create the first face of the cylindrical hole by constructing a loop with one circle. The circle is defined by the center point (0.0798, 0.0798) and radius 0.0798. Create the second face of the cylindrical hole by constructing a loop with one circle. The circle is defined by the center point (0.0798, 0.4044) and radius 0.06. Extrude the sketch along the opposite direction of the normal direction by 0.075 units. Perform a cut operation with the existing prism. The resulting CAD model consists of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole on one of its faces. The dimensions of the rectangular prism are approximately 0.351 x 0.75 x 0.351 units. The dimensions of the cylindrical hole are approximately 0.464 x 0.464 x 0.075 units. Note: The extrusion depth and scaling factor are provided in the JSON, but they can be calculated from the dimensions of the final shape.</description>",
