    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Creating the base part for a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom Construct a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin of the CAD model with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and a translation vector of (0.0, 0.375, 0.0). This will position the part in the desired location and orientation for further operations. 1.1 Create the sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. The sketch should have one face (face_1) composed of a single loop (loop_1) with 4 lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4). 1.1.1 Line_1: Begin with a line at (0.0, 0.0) and extend it to (0.75, 0.0). 1.1.2 Line_2: From the endpoint of line_1, create a line to (0.75, 0.1875). 1.1.3 Line_3: Extend line_2 to (0.0, 0.1875). 1.1.4 Lastly, complete the loop by connecting line_3 to line_1. This creates a closed rectangle. 1.2 After completing the sketch, scale it with a factor of 0.75. 1.3 Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch according to the coordinate system, defined by the Euler angles and translation vector provided earlier. The 3D sketch should now appear in its proper orientation and position. 1.4 Extrude the 3D sketch along its normal vector to a depth of 0.0938. There should be no extrusion in the opposite direction. Part 2: Creating a second part to the rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Create the second part of the rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. This part will be created using an existing coordinate system, whose parameters are derived from Part 1's coordinate system, employing the same Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and a translation vector of (0.0, 0.375, 0.0). 2.1 Develop the sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system (from Part 1), following the same structure as Part 1: Create face_1 with a single loop_1 that has 4 lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4). 2.2 Scale the sketch by 0.75 after sketch creation. 2.3 In order to position the new sketched part adjacently, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch based on the coordinate system as defined previously. 2.4 Extrude the 3D sketch along its normal vector with a depth of 0.0938. No extrusion should be done in the opposite direction. 2.5 Now, join the newly created part to the initial part from Part 1. Part 3: Creating the final part for a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Create the last part of the rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Start by using the same existing coordinate system with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and a translation vector of (0.0, 0.375, 0.0) as in Part 2. 3.1 Repeat step 2.1 for Sketch creation (face_1, loop_1, 4 lines: line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4). 3.2 Scale the newly created sketch to 0.75 of the original size. 3.3 Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch with respect to the coordinate system. 3.4 Extrude the 3D sketch along its normal vector to a depth of 0.375. 3.5 Finally, join this new part with the previous one you created in Part 2. Your final model should be a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom.</description>",

This is another significant discrepancy.\\n-Extrusion and Coordinate System values for both parts are consistent between description and JSON.\\n-The core issue is that the detailed sketch descriptions for both Part 1 and Part 2 are incomplete and do not fully match the number of loops present in the corresponding JSON sketch data.\\n\\n--Result: The description does not fully match the JSON due to missing details for the sketch loops in both Part 1 and Part 2.
