Draw the 2D sketch on the XY plane of the created coordinate system with the following components: Face 1: - Loop 1: - Line 1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0) - Line 2: (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.25) - Line 3: (0.75, 0.25) to (0.625, 0.25) - Line 4: (0.625, 0.25) to (0.625, 0.125) - Line 5: (0.625, 0.125) to (0.5, 0.125) - Line 6: (0.5, 0.125) to (0.5, 0.25) - Line 7: (0.5, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.25) - Line 8: (0.0, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.0) Ensure that the loop is closed. 3. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system parameters: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 5. Extrude the 3D sketch with the following properties: - Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.375 - Sketch scale: 0.75 - Operation: Create a new solid body</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: From the description, we have a single part labeled \",\"Part 1 Instructions Shape\",\", which will be \",\"part_1\",\" in the JSON.\\n\\npart_1: (Rectangular prism with angled face)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from \",\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\"\n,\").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from \",\"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\"\n,\").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1: (Derived from \",\"Face 1:\"\n,\".)\\n---loop_1: (Derived from \",\"Loop 1:\"\n,\".)\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Derived from \",\"Line 1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0)\"\n,\").\\n----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.25] (Derived from \",\"Line 2: (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.25)\"\n,\").\\n----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.25], End [0.625, 0.25] (Derived from \",\"Line 3: (0.75, 0.25) to (0.625, 0.25)\"\n,\").\\n----line_4: Start [0.625, 0.25], End [0.625, 0.125] (Derived from \",\"Line 4: (0.625, 0.25) to (0.625, 0.125)\"\n,\").\\n----line_5: Start [0.625, 0.125], End [0.5, 0.125] (Derived from \",\"Line 5: (0.625, 0.125) to (0.5, 0.125)\"\n,\").\\n----line_6: Start [0.5, 0.125], End [0.5, 0.25] (Derived from \",\"Line 6: (0.5, 0.125) to (0.5, 0.25)\"\n,\").\\n----line_7: Start [0.5, 0.25], End [0.0, 0.25] (Derived from \",\"Line 7: (0.5, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.25)\"\n,\").\\n----line_8: Start [0.0, 0.25], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from \",\"Line 8: (0.0, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.0)\"\n,\").\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0 (Derived from \",\"Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0\"\n,\").\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.375 (Derived from \",\"Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.375\"\n,\").\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from \",\"Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75\",\" and \"\n,\"Sketch scale: 0.75\"\n,\").\\n--operation: \",\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\",\" (Derived from \",\"Operation: Create a new solid body\"\n,\").\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check the lines (line_1 to line_8):\\nThe sequence of lines forms a closed loop as described:\\nline_1 (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0)\\nline_2 (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.25) (connects to line_1 end)\\nline_3 (0.75, 0.25) to (0.625, 0.25) (connects to line_2 end)\\nline_4 (0.625, 0.25) to (0.625, 0.125) (connects to line_3 end)\\nline_5 (0.625, 0.125) to (0.5, 0.125) (connects to line_4 end)\\nline_6 (0.5, 0.125) to (0.5, 0.25) (connects to line_5 end)\\nline_7 (0.5, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.25) (connects to line_6 end)\\nline_8 (0.0, 0.25) to (0.0, 0.0) (connects to line_7 end and closes with line_1 start)\\n--Result: The sketch loop is valid and closed.\\n\\n-Check coordinate system and transformation:\\nBoth coordinate system creation and 3D sketch transformation explicitly state Euler Angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and Translation Vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], matching the JSON.\\n\\n-Check extrusion properties:\\nExtrusion depths (towards normal 0.0, opposite normal 0.375) and sketch scale (0.75) are explicitly stated in the description and match the JSON.
