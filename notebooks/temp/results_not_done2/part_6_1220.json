The description explicitly states \\\"Rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center\\\" in the original context, but the sketch itself is a rectangle, not a circle.

The description of Part 2 mentions \\\"cylindrical hole\\\" in its heading but its sketch lines describe a rectangle. The JSON correctly represents the rectangular sketch as described by the lines. This is a potential internal inconsistency in the *original* description but not between the trimmed description and the JSON, as the JSON aligns with the detailed line instructions.\\n</think>"
