The final shape is a rectangular prism with dimensions 2x1x0.5 units, with a curved side of radius 0.5 units. This is achieved by combining part 1 and part 2 using the appropriate boolean operations. The final shape will have a rectangular face with a triangular cutout, and a cylindrical hole in the center. The exact position and orientation of these features will depend on the boolean operations used to combine part 1 and part 2.</description>",
