This is unusual for a single part extrusion but the JSON reflects it precisely by having `face_1` and `face_2` with identical geometry. The CAD software might interpret this as using the same sketch for extrusion or performing two extrusions that result in the same final body.  - The lines for `loop_1` in `face_1` (and `face_2`) connect sequentially:    - L1: [0.0, 0.1256] -> [0.2789, 0.1256]    - L2: [0.2789, 0.1256] -> [0.2789, 0.0]    - L3: [0.2789, 0.0] -> [0.75, 0.0]    - L4: [0.75, 0.0] -> [0.75, 0.3867]    - L5: [0.75, 0.3867] -> [0.2789, 0.3867]    - L6: [0.2789, 0.3867] -> [0.2789, 0.2856]    - L7: [0.2789, 0.2856] -> [0.0, 0.2856]    - L8: [0.0, 0.2856] -> [0.0, 0.1256] (connects back to L1 start).  - The loop is closed and consistent.- Check extrusion parameters:  - `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `sketch_scale` values match the description.  - `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is correctly inferred as 0.  - `operation` is correctly inferred as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\".- Conclusion: The inferred data from Step 1 accurately reflects the JSON structure and values, and the geometric logic is sound based on the description provided.
