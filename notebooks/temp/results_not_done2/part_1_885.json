This results in a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the length is 0.75 m, the width is 0.75 m, and the height is 0.15 m. The final shape is defined as a new solid body, with no material being added or removed. Additional information: The provided CAD Assembly JSON outlines the process of constructing a CAD model in four steps: defining the coordinate system, creating a 2D sketch, scaling the 2D sketch, and extruding the 2D sketch into a 3D model. Each intermediate CAD part is built upon the previous parts, using the specified operation (in this case, a NewBodyFeatureOperation). The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The shape is constructed from a single 2D sketch, which is extruded along the normal by a depth of 0.15 m. The 2D sketch is split into a single loop, which is made up of four lines. The length and width of the prism are both 0.75 m, and the height is 0.15 m.</description>",
