If the radius is 0.0352 and scale is 0.0703, then the base is very small. An extrusion of 0.75 units seems like a plausible length for a 'rod'. The description for Part 1 says \\\"Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0703 units\\\". This explicitly states the extrusion depth as 0.0703. The JSON has 0.75.
