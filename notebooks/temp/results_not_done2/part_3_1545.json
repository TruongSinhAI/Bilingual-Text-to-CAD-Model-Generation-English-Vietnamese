    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The dimensions of this prism are 0.5 units in length, 0.75 units in width, and 0.75 units in height. Observe the \"CAD Assembly JSON\" to generate the parametric CAD model with the following steps: 1. **Create a new coordinate system:** Refer to the `coordinate_system` provided in the JSON. The Euler angles are set to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This sets up the coordinate system for the 2D sketch. 2. **Draw the 2D sketch:** For this prism, use the `sketch` information in the JSON, specifically the `face_1` and `loop_1`. There are 6 lines in this loop: a. `line_1`: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] b. `line_2`: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.625] c. `line_3`: Start Point [0.75, 0.625], End Point [0.5492, 0.625] d. `line_4`: Start Point [0.5492, 0.625], End Point [0.25, 0.25] e. `line_5`: Start Point [0.25, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.25] f. `line_6`: Start Point [0.0, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.0] The loop consists of one face which is a closed curve formed by connecting the endpoints of the lines sequentially. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch:** Using the `sketch_scale` parameter provided in the `extrusion` JSON, set it to 0.75 to scale the 2D sketch. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch to 3D:** Using the euler angles [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] from the `coordinate_system` JSON, create a 3D sketch from the 2D sketch. Additionally, use the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` parameter set to 0.5 units to extrude the 3D model from the 2D sketch. Upon completion, these steps will form the first part of the CAD assembly. This part is then rotated and translated to combine as a solid body with subsequent parts according to the 'operation' specified in the `extrusion` JSON section.</description>",
