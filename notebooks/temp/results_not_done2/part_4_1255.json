Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0.0276, 0.0276, 0.0) with euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Then, create the first face and loop as follows: Face 1: Loop 1: Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.6948, 0.0) Line 2: Start Point (0.6948, 0.0), End Point (0.6948, 0.6948) Line 3: Start Point (0.6948, 0.6948), End Point (0.0, 0.6948) Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.6948), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Scale the sketch by 0.6948 and extrude the sketch by 0.0276 units towards the normal, creating a new body. The resulting part has dimensions of approximately 0.6948 units in length, 0.6948 units in width, and 0.0276 units in height. **Part 2** Construct a 3D rectangular frame with a square opening in the center.

Similar to Part 2, this is a *mismatch* in the primary operation.\\n\\n- Correction: There are multiple inconsistencies between the description and the JSON, particularly regarding the specific geometry described for the sketch (e.g., rectangle vs. triangle, rounded corners) and the intended boolean operation during extrusion for Part 2 and Part 3.\\n</think>"
