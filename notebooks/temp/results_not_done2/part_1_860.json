The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the sides are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The top and bottom faces are connected by a curved edge, and the sides are connected by straight edges. The dimensions of this part are: `length = 0.75 m`, `width = 0.0416 m`, and `height = 0.75 m`. Please note that for the boolean operation, you need to use the natural language description instead of specific terms mentioned in the JSON, such as \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\". For example, if you are cutting this part with another body, I would phrase the instruction like this: Boolean Operation Cut this part using another body. The resulting body is the intersection of this part and the other body.</description>",

Set the center of the circle to (0.0825, 0.0825) and the radius to 0.0825. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.165. Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.3 units and oppposite direction by 0 units.
