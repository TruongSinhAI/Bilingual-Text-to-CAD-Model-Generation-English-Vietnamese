It must include the two arcs (\"  ,\"arc_1\"   ,\" and \"  ,\"arc_2\"   ,\") with their start, mid, and end points to fully match the JSON data for that loop. The phrasing \"  ,\"add a curve that connects the two rectangles\"   ,\" is confusing as the arcs are part of individual loops, not connecting them in the general sense.\\n</think>"
