Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. Step 4: Transforming the 2D sketch to 3D sketch 1. Define a new coordinate system derived from the previous one, with euler angles (0, 0, 0) and translation vector (0, 0, 0). 2. Apply the euler angles and translation vector to the scaled 2D sketch and transform it into a 3D sketch. Step 5: Extruding the 3D model 1. Extrude the 3D sketch using the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value of 0.0091 and the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` value of 0. Step 6: Reviewing the part information 1. This part has a shape described as a \"rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top\". 2. The length, width, and height of the part are 0.75 m, 0.75 m, and 0.0091 m respectively. 3. The part is created using the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" boolean operation.</description>",
