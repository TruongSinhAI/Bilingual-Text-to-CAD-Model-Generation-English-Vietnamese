Next, move on to sketching. The sketch consists of two faces: * Face 1: + Loop 1: - Circle 1: * Center: [0.2181, 0.2181] * Radius: 0.2181 + Loop 2: - Circle 1: * Center: [0.2181, 0.2181] * Radius: 0.1875 * Face 2: + Loop 1: - Circle 1: * Center: [0.2181, 0.2181] * Radius: 0.1875 Now, proceed to scaling the sketch using the scaling factor 0.4362. After scaling, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined earlier. Lastly, extrude the sketch to generate the 3D model. Extrude the sketch by 0.0336 units along the normal and no extrusion in the opposite direction for a total height of 0.0336. Part 2 Construct a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. Start by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0306, 0.0306, 0.0]. Proceed to sketching. The sketch consists of a single face: * Face 1: + Loop 1: - Circle 1: * Center: [0.1875, 0.1875] * Radius: 0.1875 Scale the sketch using the scaling factor 0.375. After scaling, convert the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined earlier. Lastly, extrude the sketch to generate the 3D model. Extrude the sketch by 0.75 units along the normal and no extrusion in the opposite direction for a total height of 0.75.
