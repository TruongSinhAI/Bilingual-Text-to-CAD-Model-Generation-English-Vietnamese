This is a minor omission, but not a direct contradiction.\\n  - The `operation` \"  \n  ,\n    \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"  \n  ,\n    \" matches between description and JSON.\\n  - Result: Mismatch due to conflicting extrusion depths for multiple sketch profiles within a single part/extrusion block.\\n\\n- Correction: The description implies independent extrusions for each rectangle with differing depths, while the JSON structure indicates a single extrusion operation applying a uniform depth to all defined faces within that part's sketch. Therefore, the description does not accurately match the JSON's extrusion behavior.\\n</think>"
