Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of -90.0, 0.0, and -90.0 and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Sketching the Base of the Prism 1.

Continue the rectangle with a line from [0.5, 0.625] to [0.25, 0.625], and then a line from [0.25, 0.625] to [0.25, 0.25]. 4.

Extrude the closed loop rectangle along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.75 with the sketch scale set to 0.625. Part 2: Creating the Smaller Rectangular Prism Construct a smaller rectangular prism.

Sketching the Base of the Smaller Prism 1. Start a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a rectangle by creating a line from [0.0, 0.0] to [0.25, 0.0], followed by a line from [0.25, 0.0] to [0.25, 0.25]. 3.

Cut the smaller prism out of the larger prism by extruding the rectangle along the negative Z-axis to a depth of 0.125 with the sketch scale set to 0.25. The final shape is a larger rectangular prism with a smaller centered rectangular prism on its top, both having flat bottoms and flat tops. The larger prism is twice as long as the smaller prism along the X-axis, and the smaller prism is half as long along the Y-axis and the Z-axis.</description>",
