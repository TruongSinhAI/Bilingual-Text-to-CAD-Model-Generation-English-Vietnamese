The shape is defined by the following steps: **Step 1: Draw the 2D Sketch** 1.1. Create a new coordinate system with the provided Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and translation vector (0.0, 0.125, 0.0). 1.2. Focus on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. 1.3. Begin the sketch by drawing face 1, which is a rectangle with vertices at (0.0, 0.0), (0.25, 0.0), (0.25, 0.75), (0.0, 0.75). It consists of the following lines: - line_1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.25, 0.0) - line_2: (0.25, 0.0) to (0.25, 0.25) - line_3: (0.25, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.75) - line_4: (0.25, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75) - line_5: (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.0) 1.4. Draw face 2, which is another rectangle with vertices at (0.25, 0.0), (0.5, 0.0), (0.5, 0.25), (0.25, 0.25). It consists of the following lines: - line_1: (0.25, 0.0) to (0.5, 0.0) - line_2: (0.5, 0.0) to (0.5, 0.25) - line_3: (0.5, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.25) - line_4: (0.25, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.0) **Step 2: Scale the 2D Sketch** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75, as given by the `sketch_scale` parameter. **Step 3: Transform 2D Sketch into 3D Sketch** As the Euler angles are given, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the defined rotation. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D Sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal with an extrusion depth of 0.0625, while also extruding opposite to the normal with an extrusion depth of 0.0625 to create a closed body. After completing these steps, you will have successfully constructed the first intermediate part, a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top edge, having the following dimensions in meters: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.125 - Height: 0.75</description>",
