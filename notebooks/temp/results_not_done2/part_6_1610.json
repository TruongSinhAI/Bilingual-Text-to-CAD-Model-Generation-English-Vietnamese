Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and translation vector of 0.0, 0.05, 0.0. This will ensure that the plate is oriented correctly and positioned at the correct height. Next, create the first face of the part by creating a loop with the following curves: * A line from (0.0, 0.25) to (0.215, 0.25) * An arc with a center at (0.25, 0.215), starting at (0.215, 0.25) and ending at (0.285, 0.25) * A line from (0.285, 0.25) to (0.5, 0.25) * An arc with a center at (0.25, 0.0), starting at (0.5, 0.25) and ending at (0.0, 0.25) This will create the top edge of the plate, with the two holes on opposite sides. Next, create the second face of the part by creating another loop with the following curves: * An arc with a center at (0.25, 0.5), starting at (0.0, 0.25) and ending at (0.5, 0.25) * A line from (0.5, 0.25) to (0.5, 0.75) * A line from (0.5, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75) * A line from (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.25) This will create the bottom edge of the plate, with the same two holes on opposite sides. Next, create a third face by creating a loop with the following curves: * A line from (0.0, 0.25) to (0.215, 0.25) * An arc with a center at (0.25, 0.285), starting at (0.215, 0.25) and ending at (0.285, 0.25) * A line from (0.285, 0.25) to (0.5, 0.25) * An arc with a center at (0.25, 0.5), starting at (0.5, 0.25) and ending at (0.0, 0.25) This will create the bottom edge of the plate, with the same two holes on opposite sides.

The resulting part should have a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.04 units, and a height of 0.75 units. Part 2: Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, slightly tapered middle section, and a central hole that is slightly smaller in diameter than the cylinder itself. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and translation vector of 0.14, 0.01, 0.14. This will ensure that the cylindrical object is oriented correctly and positioned at the correct height. Next, create a face by creating a loop with a circle centered at (0.11, 0.11), and a radius of 0.11. This will form the top of the cylindrical object. Next, create a second loop with a circle centered at (0.11, 0.11), and a radius of 0.035. This will form the central hole in the cylindrical object. Finally, extrude the part by a depth of 0.01 towards the normal, and 0.0 opposite the normal. This will create a 3D model with a thickness of 0.01 units and a tapered middle section due to the different radius in the two loops.
