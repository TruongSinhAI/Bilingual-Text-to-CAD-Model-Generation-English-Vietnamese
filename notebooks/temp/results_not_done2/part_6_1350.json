Afterwards, extrude the circle along the normal direction by 0.0706 units, resulting in a cylindrical object. Part 2 Construct a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. Start with creating a new coordinate system with the same euler angles and translation vector as part 1 (0, 0.4676, 0.0066). Then, draw a sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. In the sketch, create a face and on this face, draw four lines: 1. Starting from (0, 0) and ending at (0.1424, 0) 2. Starting from (0.1424, 0) and ending at (0.1424, 0.4817) 3.

Next, draw a single face in a new sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system.

Part 4 Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles (0, 0, -90) and translation vector (0.0855, 0.4676, 0.0855). Then, create a sketch and on the face, create a circle centered at (0.162, 0.162) with a radius of 0.162. Extrude the circle along the normal vector by 0.1852 units, building the final cylindrical part. The assembly consists of several cylindrical and rectangular shapes, connected and combined using boolean operations. The component shapes have varying heights, widths, and lengths. The final assembly forms a three-dimensional metallic object with a flat base and a tapered top.</description>",
