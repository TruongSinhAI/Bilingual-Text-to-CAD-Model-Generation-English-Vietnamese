The 3D sketch should be extruded in the positive Z direction with an extrusion depth of 0.3281 units towards the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction. This will create a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a height of 0.75 units, a width of 0.3281 units, and a length of 0.75 units, including a series of cutouts on its faces.
