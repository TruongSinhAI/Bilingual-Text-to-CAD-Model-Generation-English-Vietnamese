This line will define the bottom edge of the prism. 3. Draw a line from the point `[0.3493, 0.7163]` to the point `[0.0, 0.7163]`. This line will define the right edge of the prism. 4.

    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Single, elongated, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles for this system should be set to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector should be set to [0.0, 0.0149, 0.0]. Now, create the 2D sketch for this part. The sketch will be drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. It will contain one face (face\\\\_1), which will be a closed loop of curves. The loop on face\\\\_1 consists of four curves: 1. line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.1782, 0.0] 2. line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.1782, 0.0], End Point = [0.1782, 0.75] 3. arc\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.1782, 0.75], Mid Point = [0.063, 0.6745], End Point = [0.0, 0.5521] 4. line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.0, 0.5521], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] The loop is a closed shape. The total number of curves in this loop is four. After creating the 2D sketch, scale it using the scaling parameter `sketch_scale` with a value of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. The final step is to extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model for the part. Use an `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value of 0.0149 and an `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` value of 0.0 for this extrusion operation. The height of this part is 0.75 units, width is 0.0149 units and length is 0.75 units as per the description. The above instructions will create a parametric CAD model for the first intermediate CAD part that combines with other parts to form the final cad model.</description>",
