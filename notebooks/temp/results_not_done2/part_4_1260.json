Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will serve as the reference for the first face of the sketch. 2. On this face, create a new loop, which will be a polyline (line\\\\_1 to line\\\\_9) that forms the outer boundary of the rectangular plate. 3. Add a circle (circle\\\\_1) with a center at [0.0508, 0.0763] and a radius of 0.0203 for the first circular hole. This will form the first loop_2. 4. Add a circle (circle\\\\_1) with a center at [0.4271, 0.0763] and a radius of 0.0254 for the second circular hole. This will form the second loop_3. 5. Add a circle (circle\\\\_1) with a center at [0.5593, 0.0763] and a radius of 0.0483 for the third circular hole. This will form the third loop_4. 6. Add a circle (circle\\\\_1) with a center at [0.6915, 0.0763] and a radius of 0.0254 for the fourth circular hole. This will form the fourth loop_5. Step 2: Scale the 2D sketch 1. Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75 (sketch\\\\_scale) to adjust its dimensions. Step 3: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch 1. Apply a transformation to the scaled 2D sketch using given euler angles and translation vector. Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate 3D model 1. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.0254 towards the normal. Notes 1. The resulting rectangle dimensions are approximately 0.75 x 0.75, with a height of 0.0254. 2. The circular holes have radii of 0.0203, 0.0254, 0.0483, and 0.0254, respectively. This completes the instructions for constructing the intermediate CAD part_1.</description>",

Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.25, 0.0]. This will position and orient the part correctly in the assembly. Next, create the 2D sketch for part 1. On face 1, create loop 1. Within loop 1, create line 1 from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.75, 0.0). Create line 2 from the point (0.75, 0.0) to the point (0.75, 0.5). Create line 3 from the point (0.75, 0.5) to the point (0.0, 0.5). Lastly, create line 4 from the point (0.0, 0.5) to the point (0.0, 0.0). After the sketch is completed, scale it with a factor of 0.75. Transform the 2D sketch into the 3D space using the set euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D solid model. Set extrude depth towards normal to 0.125 and extrude depth opposite normal to 0.125. **Part 2: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** Create a new coordinate system for part 2. Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.25, 0.25, 0.375]. This will position and orient the part correctly in the assembly relative to the previous part. Create the 2D sketch for part 2. Repeat the same procedure as part 1 to create the sketch, using face 1 for Part 2. Create loop 1 and within it create line 1 from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.5, 0.0); line 2 from (0.5, 0.0) to (0.5, 0.125); line 3 from (0.5, 0.125) to (0.0, 0.125); and finally line 4 from (0.0, 0.125) to (0.0, 0.0). Scale the 2D sketch with a factor of 0.5. Transform the 2D sketch and extrude it to generate the 3D solid model using the coordinate system settings specified. For extrusion, set extrude depth towards normal to 0.125 and extrude depth opposite normal to 0.125 to differentiate it from the prior part (part 1). Perform a CutFeatureOperation instead of NewBodyFeatureOperation as indicated by the JSON. The two parts (1 and 2) will now be connected with the specified boolean operation. The final assembly is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, while the front and back faces are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The sides of the prism are straight and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is centered on a white background.</description>",
