Start by creating a new coordinate system with the given Euler Angles and Translation Vector. The Euler Angles are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector is [0.0, 0.2993, 0.0199]. Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. Step 2: Draw the outline of the rectangular prism. Draw the first line from the point (0.0, 0.3062) to the point (0.4757, 0.0). Draw the second line from the point (0.4757, 0.0) to the point (0.4757, 0.7301). Draw the third line from the point (0.4757, 0.7301) to the point (0.0, 0.7301). Draw the fourth line from the point (0.0, 0.7301) to the point (0.0, 0.3062). This will create a rectangle with a length of 0.7301 units and a width of 0.2993 units. Step 3: Create the holes and cutouts. Create a circle centered at the point (0.0801, 0.6343) with a radius of 0.0658 units. This represents a circular cutout on the surface of the rectangular prism. Create a circle centered at the point (0.2936, 0.1963) with a radius of 0.1294 units. This represents a larger circular cutout on the surface of the rectangular prism. Create a circle centered at the point (0.3941, 0.6343) with a radius of 0.0675 units. This represents another circular cutout on the surface of the rectangular prism. These circles intersect with the rectangle to create various shapes and sizes of holes and cutouts on its surfaces. Step 4: Extrude the sketch to create the 3D model. Extrude the 2D sketch along its normal vector by a distance of 0.2993 units. This will create the final 3D model with a height of 0.7301 units.
