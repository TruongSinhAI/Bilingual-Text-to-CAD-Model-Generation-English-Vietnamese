Draw a line (line_1) from the point [0.0, 0.0] to the point [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Draw a line (line_2) from the point [0.75, 0.0] to the point [0.75, 0.5417]. 3. Draw a line (line_3) from the point [0.75, 0.5417] to the point [0.4083, 0.5417]. 4. Draw an arc (arc_1) from the point [0.4083, 0.5417] with a center at [0.375, 0.5083] and ending at the point [0.3417, 0.5417]. 5.

This sketch (Face 1) consists of 5 lines and 1 arc, creating a closed loop.
