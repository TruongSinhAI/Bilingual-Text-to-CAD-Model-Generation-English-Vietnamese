The description implies two separate faces (one with lines, one with a circle), but the JSON groups both into `face_1` and then adds a redundant `face_2` with the same circle. This needs to be corrected in the JSON to align with the described structure of having two distinct faces if the intent was for them to be separate top-level faces.\\n</think>"
