This orientation and positioning will ensure the correct placement and orientation of the part in the final assembly. Drawing the 2D Sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw a series of connected lines forming a closed loop as follows: 1. Line 1: Start Point (0, 0), End Point (0.75, 0) 2. Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0), End Point (0.75, 0.3214) 3. Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.3214), End Point (0.5357, 0.5357) 4.

This scaling operation will ensure that the dimensions of the part match those given in the description, resulting in a 2:1:2 aspect ratio for the dimensions of the prism. Transforming the 2D Sketch into a 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the existing coordinate system, including the specified Euler angles and translation vector. Extruding the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by a depth of 0.2143. This extrusion operation will give the prism its desired height and create the final 3D model for part 1. Recap of Part 1 After following these instructions, you will have created a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered shape, with the narrowest point at the top. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2:1:2, with the height being the longest side. This part is centered on a white background.</description>",
