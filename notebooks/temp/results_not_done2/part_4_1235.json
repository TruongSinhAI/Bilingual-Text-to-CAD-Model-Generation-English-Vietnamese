However, the provided JSON does not include a curved top. Instead, it has two flat rectangular prisms. Based on these instructions, we cannot create a final shape with a curved top edge. If you have a revised CAD Assembly JSON with the curved top prism, I can provide further instructions based on that. For now, I'm providing instructions that create two separate rectangular prisms: - **\"First rectangular prism\"** - Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom using the provided JSON. - **\"Second rectangular prism\"** - Construct another rectangular prism above the first prism based on the second part provided in the JSON. The second prism should have an extrusion depth of 0.2344 and should be joined with the previous prism. I hope these instructions are clear and helpful. If you have any questions or need additional guidance, please let me know.</description>",
