The scaling parameter for the sketch is 0.75. This will create a new solid body. Parameterize the height and width of the part Set the length parameter of the part to 0.7499, the width to 0.0395, and the height to 0.7499. This matches the size of the hollow center present in the object. This concludes the construction of the first part. The part resembles the overall shape of the final object, with a hollow center. The height of the first part coincides with the overall height of the final object, while the width is approximately half of the length provided. The thickened walls of the second part will be created using boolean operations that combine multiple parts, as described in subsequent sections.</description>",

    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: Cylindrical Object with a Tapered End** The first part of the CAD assembly is a cylindrical object with a tapered end. The final shape will have a length of 0.375 units, with a width and height of 0.045 units each. This part will serve as the base for subsequent parts in the assembly. Begin by creating a new coordinate system according to the `coordinate_system` specifications provided in the JSON. The Euler angles are set to -90.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees, and the translation vector is set to [0.375, 0.0, 0.0]. This will position and orient the sketch plane for the first part. Next, proceed to create a 2D sketch on the newly established coordinate system. The sketch should consist of a single face, face_1. This face will be the plane onto which the subsequent curves and loops will be constructed. Upon face_1, create a single loop, loop_1, consisting of a single circle, circle_1. The circle's center should be located at [0.0225, 0.0225], and its radius should be 0.0225 units. This will form the base of the cylindrical object with a tapered end. Now, scale the 2D sketch using the provided sketch scaling parameter, `sketch_scale`, which is 0.045. This scaling will be applied uniformly to the entire sketch, adjusting its dimensions to match the target length, width, and height. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided under the `coordinate_system` key. Finally, extrude the scaled and transformed 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value is 0.375, which will determine the overall length of the cylindrical object with a tapered end. The `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` value is 0.0, ensuring that no extrusion occurs in the opposite direction. After these steps, you'll have successfully created the first part of the CAD assembly—a cylindrical object with a tapered end. The completed part should match the description provided in the `description` section of the JSON, and it will later be combined with the following parts as per the defined boolean operations to form the final CAD model.</description>",
