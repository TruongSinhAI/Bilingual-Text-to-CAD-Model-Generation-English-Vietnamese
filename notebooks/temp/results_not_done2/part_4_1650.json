The radius is indeed the same (0.0415) for all circles as implied. All circle parameters in the JSON (centers and radius) match the implicit instructions for each distinct circle.\\n- Extrusion: The extrusion depth towards normal is 0.0484, matching the description. The opposite depth is correctly inferred as 0. Sketch scale is 0.5805, as specified. \"\n                                    ,\"JoinFeatureOperation\"\n                                    ,\" is consistent with creating cylindrical features that are part of a larger assembly or joined to an existing body (Part 1).\\n\\nCorrection: All inferred data matches the JSON and the description (after correction), thus no further modifications are needed.</think>"
