It has a smooth surface and appears to be a solid, possibly metallic, object. The object is centered and occupies a significant portion of the image.\" We can infer that this part is a cylinder with a uniform radius throughout and a varying height, forming a taper at the top and bottom. 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 for the base of the cylindrical object. **Sketch for Face 1** To create the base of the cylindrical object, we will draw two circles representing the inner and outer circumferences of the part. 1. Draw the first loop (loop_1) by creating a circle (circle_1) centered at (0.041, 0.041) with a radius of 0.041 units. This circle defines the outer circumference of the part. 2. Draw the second loop (loop_2) by creating another circle (circle_1) centered at (0.041, 0.041) with a radius of 0.0293 units. This circle defines the inner circumference of the part. * At this point, you have created two circles - one for the outer circumference and one for the inner circumference - representing the base of the tapered cylindrical object. **Extrusion for Face 1** Now, we will extrude the sketch drawn above to create the 3D model of the part. 1. Extrude the sketch created in the previous step by the amount of 0.75 units along the normal vector. This forms the base of the tapered cylindrical object. 2. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.082 before the extrusion. With the instructions above, you will be able to generate an accurate CAD model for part_1. The length, width, and height of part_1 are 0.082 units, 0.082 units, and 0.75 units respectively.
