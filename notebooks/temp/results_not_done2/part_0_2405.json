    "prompt": "<description>**Instructions for Generating Intermediate Parts and Final Shape** **Part 1** Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation (euler angles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and a translation vector of (0.0, 0.1856, 0.0). For the sketch, create a rectangle on face 1 as follows: - Create loop 1 with 4 lines: * Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.2822) * Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.2822), End Point (0.0, 0.2822) * Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.2822), End Point (0.0, 0.0) After the sketch is created, scale it by 0.75, create a 3D sketch from it, and then apply an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.0464 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. This will form part 1, which has dimensions 0.75x0.75x0.0464 units. **Part 2** Construct a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a smaller rectangular prism on top of it. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation (euler angles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and a translation vector of (0.1856, 0.0, 0.0464). For the sketch, create two rectangles on faces 1 and 2: - On face 1: * Create loop 1 with 4 lines: + Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.0464, 0.0) + Line 2: Start Point (0.0464, 0.0), End Point (0.0464, 0.1856) + Line 3: Start Point (0.0464, 0.1856), End Point (0.0, 0.1856) + Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.1856), End Point (0.0, 0.0) - On face 2: * Create loop 1 with 4 lines: + Line 1: Start Point (0.3323, 0.0), End Point (0.3787, 0.0) + Line 2: Start Point (0.3787, 0.0), End Point (0.3787, 0.1856) + Line 3: Start Point (0.3787, 0.1856), End Point (0.3323, 0.1856) + Line 4: Start Point (0.3323, 0.1856), End Point (0.3323, 0.0) After the sketch is created, apply an extrusion depth toward the normal of 0 units and an opposite direction extrusion depth of 0.0464 units. When scaling the sketch by 0.3787, part 2 will have dimensions 0.3787x0.3787x0.0464 units. **Final Shape** Assemble part 1 and part 2 using the join operation. The final shape is not explicitly scaled, thus part 1's scaling property will dictate the overall size. Since part 1 has dimensions 0.75x0.75x0.0464 units, the ```less final shape will have dimensions 0.75x0.75x0.5328 (0.0464 x 2 for the height, since there are two parts stacked on top of each other). The cylindrical hole is not part of the given JSON data, but it is indirectly represented by the dimensions of the parts provided. ```</description>",
