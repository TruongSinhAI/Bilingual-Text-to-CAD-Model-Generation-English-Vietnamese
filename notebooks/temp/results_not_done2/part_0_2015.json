    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: A Long, Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** **Step 1: Create the Coordinate System** Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0342, 0.0] **Step 2: Draw the Sketch** On the XY plane of the created coordinate system, draw a 2D sketch and create a new face. Create a loop on this face. The loop should consist of 4 line segments: line 1: Starting point [0.0, 0.0], Ending point [0.0333, 0.0] line 2: Starting point [0.0333, 0.0], Ending point [0.0333, 0.75] line 3: Starting point [0.0333, 0.75], Ending point [0.0, 0.75] line 4: Starting point [0.0, 0.75], Ending point [0.0, 0.0] Each line segment forms one side of the rectangular prism. The length of the prism is 0.75 units and the width is 0.0342 units (height in the Z direction is not considered in the sketch). **Step 3: Apply Scaling and Transformation to the Sketch** Scale the sketched shape by 0.75, so that the final dimensions match the intended measurements and adjust for any distortions. Transform the sketch into a 3D shape using the given euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 4: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.0342 units in the direction of the normal, resulting in a 3D shape. Since we didn't specify any opposite normal extrusion depth, it defaults to 0. After these steps, you will get a long, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom as the first intermediate part. The final shape of this intermediate part matches the \"description\" provided in the JSON: shape: \"A long, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.\" length: 0.75 width: 0.0342 height: 0.75</description>",
