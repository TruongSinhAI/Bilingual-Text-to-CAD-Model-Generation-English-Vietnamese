For the sketch, create a new 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch contains two loops, both consisting of a single circle. 1. Loop 1: * Center: [0.375, 0.375] * Radius: 0.375 2. Loop 2: * Center: [0.375, 0.375] * Radius: 0.3615 Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the sketch by 0.5905 towards the normal, and by 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal. This results in a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered middle section. Part 2: Large Flat Object with a Curved Top Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector of [0.0135, 0.0135, 0.0]. For the sketch, create a new 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. In the sketch, create a single loop consisting of a circle. 1.

Extrude the sketch by 0.059 towards the normal, and by 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal. This results in a large, round, flat object with a slightly curved top. Part 3: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. For the sketch, create a new 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. In the sketch, create a loop consisting of four lines. 1.

Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the sketch by 0.0295 towards the normal, and by 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal.
