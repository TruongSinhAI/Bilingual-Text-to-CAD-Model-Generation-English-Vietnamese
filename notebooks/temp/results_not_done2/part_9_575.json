The JSON only defines an initial coordinate system for the 2D sketch, not a subsequent transformation for the 3D sketch before extrusion.

This is an arithmetic mismatch.- Corrections: The JSON's \"\n                ,\"part_1\"\n                ,\" lacks the explicit 3D sketch transformation described.

The operation is consistent.- Discrepancy: The description states that `Face 2` is \"\n                ,\"on a plane rotated 90 degrees around the Y axis from the bottom face\"\n                ,\" (Face 1). However, in the JSON, both `face_1` and `face_2` are nested under a single `sketch` object, which typically implies that they are coplanar (exist on the same 2D plane). If these faces were intended to be on different, rotated planes, the JSON structure would generally require separate `sketch` objects, each with its own coordinate system to define its plane. Therefore, the JSON's current structure does not fully represent the descriptive intent of `face_2` being on a rotated plane.Correction: The JSON structure for the sketch, with both faces under a single `sketch` object, does not support the description's implication of `face_2` being on a separate, rotated plane. This is a fundamental structural inconsistency between the description and the JSON representation for a multi-planar sketch.</think>"

If these faces were intended to be on different planes, the JSON structure would generally require separate `sketch` objects, each with its own coordinate system to define its plane. Therefore, the JSON's current structure does not align with the implied multi-planar nature of the prism's faces as suggested by the description.Correction: The JSON structure does not fully support the conceptual division of `Face 1` and `Face 2` as distinct non-coplanar faces of a 3D prism. To fully match the description's implication of separate prism faces, the JSON would likely need a more complex structure, such as separate `sketch` objects for each face or a different method of defining a multi-face prism directly.</think>"
