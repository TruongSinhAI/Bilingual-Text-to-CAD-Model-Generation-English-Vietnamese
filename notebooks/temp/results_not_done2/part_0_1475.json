    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal and the height is half the length of the sides. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles for this coordinate system are -90.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees, and the translation vector is [0.7113, 0.0, 0.0]. Next, create the 2D sketch for the prism on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch consists of four lines that form a square. The first line starts at the origin [0.0, 0.0] and ends at [0.6897, 0.0]. The second line starts at [0.6897, 0.0] and ends at [0.6897, 0.75]. The third line starts at [0.6897, 0.75] and ends at [0.0, 0.75]. The fourth line starts at [0.0, 0.75] and ends at the origin. Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model of the prism. The extrude depth towards the normal is 0.0 and the extrude depth opposite the normal is 0.7113. Part 2 Construct a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top.
