Close the loop. **Extrusion step:** Extrude the resulting 2D sketch into a 3D model with a depth of 0.25 towards the normal direction, and a scale of 0.5. For this part, the extrusion operation involves adding material. Part 2: Construction of a Smaller Rectangular Prism Create a new coordinate system with no rotation but with a translation vector of (0.5, 0, 0). **Sketching step 1:** Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. **Sketching step 2:** Draw the first line from (0, 0) to (0.125, 0). **Sketching step 3:** Draw the second line from (0.125, 0) to (0.125, 0.375). **Sketching step 4:** Draw the third line from (0.125, 0.375) to (0, 0.375). **Sketching step 5:** Draw the fourth line from (0, 0.375) to (0, 0). This closes the loop. **Extrusion step:** Extrude the 2D sketch to create a 3D prism of height 0.125 along the positive Z direction. The operation involved here is merging the current 3D model with the previously created part. Part 3: Construction of a Slanted Top Rectangular Prism Create a new coordinate system with no rotation but with a translation vector of (0.625, 0, 0). **Sketching step 1:** Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. **Sketching step 2:** Draw the first line from (0, 0) to (0.125, 0). **Sketching step 3:** Draw the second line from (0.125, 0) to (0.125, 0.375). **Sketching step 4:** Draw the third line from (0.125, 0.375) to (0, 0.375). **Sketching step 5:** Draw the fourth line from (0, 0.375) to (0, 0). Close the loop. **Extrusion step:** Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model with a depth of 0.25 towards the normal direction and a scale of 0.375. The operation involved at this stage is merging the current 3D model with the previously built part. After completing **Part 3**, you will have created a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a slightly angled top surface.
