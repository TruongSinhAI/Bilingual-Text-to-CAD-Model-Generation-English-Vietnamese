    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Metal Plate with Rounded Corners and Two Holes on the Top Side Step 1: Creating the Coordinate System The first step to construct part 1 is to create a new coordinate system. The Euler angles for this coordinate system are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is [0.0146, 0.0338, 0.0]. Step 2: Creating the Sketch Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the newly created coordinate system. The sketch consists of three loops (loop\\\\_1, loop\\\\_2, loop\\\\_3) and one face (face\\\\_1). Face 1 Loop 1 Loop 1 consists of 5 lines and 3 arcs: * Arc 1: Start Point [0.037, 0.5711], Mid Point [0.1177, 0.4965], End Point [0.1476, 0.3906] * Line 1: Start Point [0.1476, 0.3906], End Point [0.1476, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.1476, 0.0], End Point [0.5124, 0.0] * Line 3: Start Point [0.5124, 0.0], End Point [0.553, 0.0] * Line 4: Start Point [0.553, 0.0], End Point [0.553, 0.6622] * Arc 2: Start Point [0.553, 0.6622], Mid Point [0.5411, 0.6908], End Point [0.5124, 0.7027] * Line 5: Start Point [0.5124, 0.7027], End Point [0.2196, 0.7027] * Arc 3: Start Point [0.2196, 0.7027], Mid Point [0.1763, 0.7098], End Point [0.1375, 0.7305] * Arc 4: Start Point [0.1375, 0.7305], Mid Point [0.0, 0.7059], End Point [0.037, 0.5711] This loop forms the outer boundary of the rectangular metal plate with rounded corners. Loop 2 Loop 2 consists of one circle: * Circle 1: Center [0.08, 0.6554], Radius 0.0338 This loop represents the first hole on the top side of the metal plate. Loop 3 Loop 3 consists of one circle: * Circle 1: Center [0.3503, 0.0811], Radius 0.0338 This loop represents the second hole on the top side of the metal plate. Step 3: Scaling the Sketch Scale the 2D sketch by 0.7305 using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter. Step 4: Transforming the Sketch into 3D Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Step 5: Extruding the Sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0338 to create the 3D model of the rectangular metal plate with rounded corners and two holes on the top side. The final shape has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.7305 * Width: 0.0338 * Height: 0.7305</description>",
