Also, the description states 0.0221 'towards normal' and 0 'opposite normal', while JSON states 0 'towards normal' and 0.0221 'opposite normal'. This is a direct contradiction. The operation \"  ,  \"CutFeatureOperation\"  ,  \" from JSON implies a cut *into* the existing body, which would typically be an extrusion *opposite* the normal, consistent with the JSON's `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0221`.

Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.2125 units along the normal direction for building the first solid part. Final Part Details - This part is a rectangular prism with two circular holes on opposite sides. The length, width, and height of the part are 0.75, 0.75, and 0.2125 units, respectively. - This part involves creating three faces with one circular hole on each face. Two circular arcs define these holes on the first part. The centers and radii of the first and second circular arcs are (0.125, 0.2813) and 0.0424, respectively. - The third face contains the second circular arc with the same center and radius (0.125, 0.6563) and 0.0424 as the second circular arc of the first face. This results in two circular holes on opposite faces of the rectangular prism on the final shape.</description>",
