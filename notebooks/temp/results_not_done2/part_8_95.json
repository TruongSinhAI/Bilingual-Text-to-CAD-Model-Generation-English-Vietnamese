Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees, and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0375, 0.0]. This configuration will position and orient your first sketch. **Step 2: Create a Sketch on face_1** Create the first sketch on the X-Y plane of the defined coordinate system. **Step 3: Draw the Rectangular Perimeter** Draw the rectangular perimeter with the following lines: 1. Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Draw a line from point [0.75, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.3]. 3. Draw a line from point [0.75, 0.3] to point [0.0, 0.3]. 4. Close the loop by drawing a line from point [0.0, 0.3] to point [0.0, 0.0]. **Step 4: Draw the Holes' Circular Perimeters** On the same sketch, draw two circles to represent the holes on the top side of the metal plate: 1. The first hole is centred at point [0.1875, 0.075] with a radius of 0.03. 2. The second hole is centred at point [0.5625, 0.075] with a radius of 0.03. **Step 5: Scale the Sketch** Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 6: Extrude the Sketch into a 3D Solid** Extrude the sketch along its normal by 0.0375 units. The operation should create a new solid. Finished! You have now created the first parametric CAD part of a rectangular metal plate with two holes on the top side.
