For the sketch, focus on face_1 which has a single loop, loop_1. Loop_1 is built from four lines: - line_1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] - line_2: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.75] - line_3: [0.75, 0.75] to [0.0, 0.75] - line_4: [0.0, 0.75] to [0.0, 0.0] Scale the 2D sketch by 0.75x using the sketch_scale parameter. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D space using a combination of the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate_system. The specific values are not needed here, but the default [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] angels and vector should be enough for flat sketch. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.75 units in the positive axial direction (towards the normal) for the final part. This is the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" as stated in the JSON, but you can silence this term in your instructions. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The resulting part has length, width and height of 0.75 units each. **Additional Parts (if available)** Repeat the following steps for every additional part listed in the JSON, don't forget to restate the shape being constructed before diving into detailed instructions. Additionally, ensure to include any changes in sketch constraints, scaling, transformation, and extrusion operations based on the provided JSON. Keep in mind when extruding a 2D sketch, the extrusion depth is often different than the sketch scale. Be mindful of these differences and don't forget to mention whether the extrusion depth is towards the normal or opposite. When a loop consists of multiple lines, explicitly indicate this in your instructions.</description>",
