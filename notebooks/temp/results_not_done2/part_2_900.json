    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism** **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** No rotation is necessary for this part, so set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. The translation vector should also be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will position the prism at the origin. **Step 2: Create the 2D sketch** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (since the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]). *Curve 1: Line 1-2* Create a line with a start point at [0.0, 0.0] and an end point at [0.75, 0.0]. *Curve 2: Line 2-3* Create a line with a start point at [0.75, 0.0] and an end point at [0.75, 0.7167]. *Curve 3: Line 3-4* Create a line with a start point at [0.75, 0.7167] and an end point at [0.0, 0.7167]. *Curve 4: Line 4-1* Create a line with a start point at [0.0, 0.7167] and an end point at [0.0, 0.0]. This line closes the loop and forms a face. **Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Since no rotation is necessary, the euler angles do not need to be modified. However, the translation vector can be used to move the prism away from the origin if desired. Keep in mind that the extrusion depth will be relative to the position of the 2D sketch after transformation. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model** The sketch should be extruded along the normal vector by a distance of 0.025 units. The final shape will be a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. The length and width are 0.75 units, and the height is 0.025 units. **Part 2 and Beyond: Further Part Instructions** Repeat the same process for subsequent parts. Remember to create a new coordinate system for each part, drawing the 2D sketch on its plane, transforming the sketch as necessary, and extruding it to create the 3D model. Make sure to consider the position and orientation of each part as well as its size and shape. When describing the parts, include information about the curves, loops, and faces necessary to construct them. Ensure that the loops are closed, and that the sketches are suitable for extrusion. Also, provide information about the height, width, and length of each part. By following these instructions and carefully considering the information provided in the JSON, you should be able to create an accurate CAD model of the final shape.</description>",
