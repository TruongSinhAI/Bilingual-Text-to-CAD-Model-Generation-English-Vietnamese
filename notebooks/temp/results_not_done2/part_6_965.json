Draw a line (line\\\\_4) from coordinates (0.0, 0.2853) back to the start point (0.0, 0.0). After drawing the lines, use the `sketch_scale` parameter of `0.587` to scale the base sketch. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translate vector (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Extrude the 2D sketch by `0.75` units in the normal direction to create the prism with the following dimensions: `length = 0.587`, `width = 0.587`, and `height = 0.75`.

After drawing the lines, use the `sketch_scale` parameter of `0.7174` to scale the base sketch. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translate vector (0.0163, 0.0, 0.0163). Instead of extruding, apply a cut feature operation with 0 as the towards normal depth and `0.0245` units in the opposite direction of the normal. This will create a prism with the following dimensions: `length = 0.7174`, `width = 0.0245`, and `height = 0.7174`.</description>",
