    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Creating the Base Frame** The CAD model to be constructed is a rectangular metal frame with four vertical bars and two horizontal bars. The frame is symmetrical and has a flat top and bottom. The vertical bars are evenly spaced and the horizontal bars are centered between the vertical bars. The final shape has a length and width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.0125 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system, aligned with the world coordinates (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and no rotation. *Sketching the Base Rectangle* Now, let's create the base rectangle for vertical bars, which will determine the width and length. 1. Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (defined by the coordinate system). 2. Draw the first line from (0, 0) to (0.75, 0), then draw the second line from (0.75, 0) to (0.75, 0.25), then draw the third line from (0.75, 0.25) to (0, 0.25), finally draw the fourth line from (0, 0.25) to (0, 0). This completes the exterior outline. *Sketching Inner Horizontal Rectangles* Next, add the inner horizontal rectangles that will define the horizontal bars. 1. Create a new loop starting at (0.0083, 0.0083), then draw a line to (0.7417, 0.0083), followed by a line to (0.7417, 0.0583), next a line to (0.0083, 0.0583), and finally a line to (0.0083, 0.0083). This completes the loop, forming the first horizontal rectangle. 2. Repeat the above process to create the remaining horizontal rectangles at the desired heights, such as at 0.0708, 0.1312, 0.1917, and 0.2417 units. *Extruding the Frame* Now, it's time to extrude the sketched geometry into a 3D shape. 1. Extrude the entire sketch by 0.0125 units in the positive Z direction. After following these instructions, the first part of the CAD model, corresponding to the base frame, should be complete. Continue building the remaining CAD models by following the JSON data for each part. Maintain a clear and concise approach, and avoid using specific boolean operation terms.</description>",
