The opposite direction extrusion depth should be set to 0.0. Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch before extrusion. The operation for this part is to create a new solid body. **Additional Information** The resulting part will have the following dimensions: - Length: 0.028 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.75 units The shape of the part is a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The taper is a result of the scaling operation being applied only to the X and Y dimensions, while the Z dimension remains unchanged.</description>",
