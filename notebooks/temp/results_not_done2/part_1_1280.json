As there's no specified opposite normal depth value, it defaults to zero. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D Sketch to generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch along its normals to create the final 3D model for this part. The dimensions of this intermediate part are as follows: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.0134 units The final shape of this intermediate part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered shape, with the narrowest point at the top. The sides of the prism are parallel to each other.</description>",
