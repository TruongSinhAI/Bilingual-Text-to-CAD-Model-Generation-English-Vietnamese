Sketch Face 3 Create a circle on the XY plane with a center at (0.625, 0.125) and a radius of 0.125. This forms loop 1 of face 3. Create another circle on the XY plane with a center at (0.625, 0.125) and a radius of 0.0625. This forms loop 2 of face 3. You have now created three faces each containing one or two loops. The total number of curves (lines and arcs) across all loops is 8. Extrusion Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.125 units in the positive direction and 0 units in the negative direction. Apply a sketch scale factor of 0.75.
