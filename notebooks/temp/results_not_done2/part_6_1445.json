    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom Determine the coordinate system with the euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector also set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This sets the default position of the 2D sketch plane. Create a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw rectangular face with four lines on the 2D sketch plane for face 1. Name the lines as below: Line 1: Start point [0.0, 0.0], End point [0.75, 0.0] Line 2: Start point [0.75, 0.0], End point [0.75, 0.4368] Line 3: Start point [0.75, 0.4368], End point [0.0, 0.4368] Line 4: Start point [0.0, 0.4368], End point [0.0, 0.0] Loops are used to connect a chain of edges seamlessly. Ensure that the above four lines form one loop (loop_1) and the loop is closed. Also, make sure that a loop can consist of multiple lines and/or arcs, but not a mix of lines and circles or arcs and circles. After drawing and assembling loops, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch scale parameter provided in the description. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system and apply the given extrude_depth_towards_normal and extrude_depth_opposite_normal values to extrude the 2D sketch along the normal and opposite normal respectively. Use the provided sketch_scale factor in the operation to create the 3D prism. Arrived at the final shape, a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom of length 0.75, width 0.75 and height 0.5756. The instructions provided above would help the junior CAD designer to generate an accurate CAD model for part 1. By following these steps, the desired part can be created in the context of the final shape as inferred from the VLM model. However, it's essential to reiterate that these instructions should be followed without making any assumptions other than the ones explicitly stated. This will ensure the desired CAD model is built as intended.</description>",

For the sketch, draw a rectangle on face 1 of the coordinate system. This rectangle will have 4 lines: 1. Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] 2.

Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.75], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion method is `NewBodyFeatureOperation`, with an extrude depth towards the normal of 0.1828 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. After this step, you will have a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom where the length, width, and height are 0.75 units, 0.75 units, and 0.1828 units, respectively. **Part 2: Construct a recessed rectangular part** Create a new coordinate system with a slight translation from the previous part to position the base at [0.0938, 0.5156, 0.1828]. The orientation remains the same with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. For the sketch, draw a rectangle on face 1 that is smaller in size than the rectangle in Part 1. This rectangle will have 4 lines: 1. Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.1406, 0.0] 2. Line 2: Start Point = [0.1406, 0.0], End Point = [0.1406, 0.1406] 3.

The cutting between the two shapes occurs only in the opposite direction of the normal, penetrating by 0.0469 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.1406. This part of the CAD model is a recessed rectangular part inserted in the main body of the prism. The length, width, and height of the recessed rectangular part are 0.1406 units, 0.1406 units, and 0.0469 units, respectively.
