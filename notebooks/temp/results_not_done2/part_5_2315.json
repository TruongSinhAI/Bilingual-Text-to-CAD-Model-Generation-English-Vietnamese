    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top First, let's define the coordinate system for this part. The euler angles are set to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the translation vector is set to [0.375, 0, 0]. This will position and orient the part as required. Next, we need to create the 2D sketch for this part. We will be sketching on a plane defined by the coordinate system. Initialize the sketch by creating a new face, face_1. In face_1, we will create the following loops: 1. loop_1: - arc_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0149], Mid Point [0.0149, 0], End Point [0.0298, 0.0149] - line_1: Start Point [0.0298, 0.0149], End Point [0.0298, 0.0697] - arc_2: Start Point [0.0298, 0.0697], Mid Point [0.0149, 0.0846], End Point [0.0, 0.0697] - line_2: Start Point [0.0, 0.0697], End Point [0.0, 0.0149] This loop describes a closed shape. The sketch is complete after creating loop_1. After completing the sketch, scale it using the sketch_scale parameter, which is set to 0.0846. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate_system. Now, extrude the 3D sketch along the sketch normal to create the 3D model. Set the extrusion values: - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1875 - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.1875 Finally, this part will be added as a new body to the overall CAD model. Height: 0.375 Width: 0.0846 Length: 0.375 Continue with generating the details for the next parts according to the CAD Assembly JSON.</description>",
