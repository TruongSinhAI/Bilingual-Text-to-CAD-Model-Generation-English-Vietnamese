    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** The first part of the CAD model is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. This part is constructed by first creating a coordinate system with a specific orientation and location, then drawing a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system, and finally extruding the sketch to create the 3D model. **Section 1: Coordinate System** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [ -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 ] - Translation Vector: [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] **Section 2: 2D Sketch** On the plane defined by the new coordinate system, draw a 2D sketch consisting of the following: - Face 1: - Loop 1: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.1927, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.1927, 0.0], End Point [0.1927, 0.1875] - Line 3: Start Point [0.1927, 0.1875], End Point [0.1492, 0.1875] - Arc 1: Start Point [0.1492, 0.1875], Mid Point [0.1361, 0.1821], End Point [0.1307, 0.169] - Line 4: Start Point [0.1307, 0.169], End Point [0.1307, 0.0591] - Line 5: Start Point [0.1307, 0.0591], End Point [0.0185, 0.0591] - Arc 2: Start Point [0.0185, 0.0591], Mid Point [0.0054, 0.0537], End Point [0.0, 0.0407] - Line 6: Start Point [0.0, 0.0407], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This sketch is a closed loop consisting of multiple lines and arcs that form the perimeter of the rectangular prism's base. **Section 3: Extrusion** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction with a depth of 0.75 units, representing the height of the prism. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.1927. This operation creates a new solid body. The resulting part has the following dimensions: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.1927 - Height: 0.1927 This completes the instructions for constructing the first part of the CAD model, a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The next section will describe the construction of additional parts.</description>",
