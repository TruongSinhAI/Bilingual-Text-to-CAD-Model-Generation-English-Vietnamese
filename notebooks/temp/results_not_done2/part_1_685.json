Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [-0.9013, 0.6567, -1.9688] 2. Draw the first face of the prism as a 2D sketch using the following guidelines: - Create line 1 from (0.0, 0.4372) to (3.6932, 0.0). - Create line 2 from (3.6932, 0.0) to (3.6932, 2.349). - Create line 3 from (3.6932, 2.349) to (0.8418, 1.5687). - Create line 4 from (0.8418, 1.5687) to (0.6925, 1.958). - Create line 5 from (0.6925, 1.958) to (0.6925, 0.4372). - Close the loop by creating line 6 from (0.6925, 0.4372) to (0.0, 0.4372). 3.

Checking connectivity:\\\\n  - Line 1 (Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.2539, 0.0]) connects correctly to Line 2.\\\\n  - Line 2 (Start [0.2539, 0.0], End [0.2539, 0.127]) connects correctly to Line 3.\\\\n  - Line 3 (Start [0.2539, 0.127], End [0.5197, 0.127]) connects correctly to Line 4.\\\\n  - Line 4 (Start [0.5197, 0.127], End [0.5197, 0.0]) connects correctly to Line 5.\\\\n  - Line 5 (Start [0.5197, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0]) connects correctly to Line 6.\\\\n  - Line 6 (Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.5197, 0.4341]) connects correctly to Line 7.\\\\n  - Line 7 (Start [0.5197, 0.4341], End [0.2539, 0.4341]) connects correctly to Line 8.\\\\n  - Line 8 (Start [0.2539, 0.4341], End [0.0, 0.0]) connects back to the start of Line 1. The loop is valid and closed.\\\\n- The extrusion parameters (extrude_depth_towards_normal, extrude_depth_opposite_normal, sketch_scale) match the JSON exactly. The `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is correctly inferred as 0.0.\\\\n- The operation \\\\\"  \n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\\\"  \n    ,\" is a logical inference for generating a new body.\\\\n- No corrections are necessary as the inferred data is accurate and fully consistent with the provided JSON.\\\\n</think>"
