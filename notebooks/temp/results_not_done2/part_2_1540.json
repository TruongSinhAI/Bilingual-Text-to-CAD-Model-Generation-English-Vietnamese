Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to form the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.1875 units in both the positive and negative directions along the normal vector to create a fully formed 3D part with the following dimensions: * length: 0.1667 * width: 0.375 * height: 0.1667 Final Shape: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Step 1: Position the previoulsy created part Position the previously created rectangular prism in the final coordinate system. Step 2: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no translation and a rotation of 90 degrees around the Z axis. Step 3: Draw a 2D sketch on the Y-Z plane 1. Create a new sketch on the Y-Z plane of the initial coordinate system with the newly created coordinate system. 2. Draw a rectangle using the following line segments: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.375, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.375] * Line 3: Start Point [0.375, 0.375], End Point [0.0, 0.375] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.375], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.1667. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to form the second part of the final 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.415 units in the positive direction along the normal vector to form the top part of the final 3D shape. Step 6: Subtract the second part from the first part Perform a subtraction operation between the first created rectangular prism and the top rectangle just created to form the final shape: a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.</description>",
