Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles (0, 0, 0) and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0). 2. Next, create a plane using the information provided in the coordinate system. 3. To create the first face of the prism, we'll generate a 2D sketch on the plane. This face will consist of two loops. - *First Loop*: - Draw an arc with a start point at (0, 0.0034), a midpoint at (0.001, 0.001), and an endpoint at (0.0034, 0). Connect this arc to the next line segment using the 'line_1' in the JSON. - Draw a line (line_1) from the endpoint of the arc (0.0034, 0) to the point (0.0315, 0) using the 'line_1' JSON data. - Draw an arc (arc_2) with a start point at (0.0315, 0), a midpoint at (0.0339, 0.001), and an endpoint at (0.035, 0.0034). Connect the arc to the next line segment using the 'line_2' in the JSON. - Draw a line (line_2) from the endpoint of the arc (0.035, 0.0034) to the point (0.035, 0.0315) using the 'line_2' JSON data. - Draw an arc (arc_3) with a start point at (0.035, 0.0315), a midpoint at (0.0339, 0.0339), and an endpoint at (0.0315, 0.035). Connect the arc to the next line segment using the 'line_3' in the JSON. - Draw a line (line_3) from the endpoint of the arc (0.0315, 0.035) to the point (0.0034, 0.035) using the 'line_3' JSON data. - Draw an arc (arc_4) with a start point at (0.0034, 0.035), a midpoint at (0.001, 0.0339), and an endpoint at (0.0, 0.0315). Connect this arc to the first line segment (line_4) using the JSON data and create a closed loop. - *Second Loop*: - Draw a line (line_1) from the point (0.0022, 0.0022) to the point (0.0328, 0.0022) using the 'line_1' JSON data. - Draw a line (line_2) from the point (0.0328, 0.0022) to the point (0.0328, 0.0328) using the 'line_2' JSON data. - Draw a line (line_3) from the point (0.0328, 0.0328) to the point (0.0022, 0.0328) using the 'line_3' JSON data. - Draw a line (line_4) from the point (0.0022, 0.0328) to the point (0.0022, 0.0022) using the 'line_4' JSON data. 4.
