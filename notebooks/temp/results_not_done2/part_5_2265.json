The euler angles are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.154, 0.0]. Now, let's create the 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. We will create a rectangle. 1. Create the first line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.4632, 0.0]. 2. Create the second line from point [0.4632, 0.0] to point [0.4632, 0.75]. 3. Create the third line from point [0.4632, 0.75] to point [0.0, 0.75]. 4. Create the fourth line from point [0.0, 0.75] to point [0.0, 0.0]. This rectangle forms a single face (face_1) in the 2D sketch, consisting of one loop (loop_1), which contains four lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, line_4). The loop is closed as each of the lines are connected end-to-end. Now, let's scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the `sketch_scale` parameter. Next, we need to transform our scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying a 3D rotation, followed by a translation. Using the provided coordinate system's euler angles, apply a rotation in the order of Z-axis, Y-axis, and then X-axis. The translation vector will then move the scaled 2D sketch along the Z-axis. Lastly, we will extrude the 2D sketch by the value of `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.154 units) to generate the 3D model. We can ignore the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` value for this part since it's not needed. The `description` of the final part provides the shape as a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal with a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.154 units, and a height of 0.75 units (but remember, the height value provided is the height after scaling and needs to be adjusted according to the scaling factor in the part instructions). Since this is part 1 of the CAD assembly, it does not require any boolean operation with a preceding CAD model.</description>",
