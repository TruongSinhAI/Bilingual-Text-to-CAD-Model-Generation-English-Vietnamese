A line from point (0.6667, 0.0) to point (0.6667, 0.6667). 3. A line from point (0.6667, 0.6667) to point (0.0, 0.6667). 4. A line from point (0.0, 0.6667) to point (0.0, 0.0). Once the loop is complete, scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6667. Finally, extrude the sketch by 0.0417 units towards the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, with a length and width of 0.6667 units and a height of 0.0417 units.
