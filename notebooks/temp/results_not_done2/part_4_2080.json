    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal and the height is half the width. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.6276, 0.0] Now, create the 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single face (face_1) with a loop (loop_1) containing the following lines and their respective start and end points: 1. line_1: [0.0, 0.4174], [0.0172, 0.2067] 2. line_2: [0.0172, 0.2067], [0.2054, 0.0199] 3. line_3: [0.2054, 0.0199], [0.4519, 0.0] 4. line_4: [0.4519, 0.0], [0.6718, 0.0742] 5. line_5: [0.6718, 0.0742], [0.75, 0.2504] 6. line_6: [0.75, 0.2504], [0.7155, 0.436] 7. line_7: [0.7155, 0.436], [0.5645, 0.6957] 8. line_8: [0.5645, 0.6957], [0.2889, 0.6957] 9. line_9: [0.2889, 0.6957], [0.1126, 0.5711] 10. line_10: [0.1126, 0.5711], [0.0, 0.4174] Each line forms a closed loop, consisting of multiple lines. No loops consist of a line and a circle, or an arc and a circle. To generate the 3D model, extrude the 2D sketch along the normal with an extrusion depth of 0.6276, and an opposite normal depth of 0.0. Apply a sketch scale of 0.75 to the sketch.
