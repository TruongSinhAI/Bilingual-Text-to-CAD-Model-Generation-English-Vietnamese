    "reasoning": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** The first part of the CAD model is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. **Coordinate System Setup** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0352, 0.0] **Sketching the Base** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw the following curves: * Arc 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0117], Mid Point [0.0034, 0.0034], End Point [0.0117, 0.0] * Line 1: Start Point [0.0117, 0.0], End Point [0.1641, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.1641, 0.0], End Point [0.2812, 0.6094] * Line 3: Start Point [0.2812, 0.6094], End Point [0.2812, 0.75] * Line 4: Start Point [0.2812, 0.75], End Point [0.0117, 0.75] * Arc 2: Start Point [0.0117, 0.75], Mid Point [0.0034, 0.7466], End Point [0.0, 0.7383] * Line 5: Start Point [0.0, 0.7383], End Point [0.0, 0.0117] These curves form loop 1, which closes the shape.
