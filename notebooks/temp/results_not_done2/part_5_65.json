These are treated as separate loops within the same face, which is standard for defining holes.\\n- Extrusion: The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0006) and `sketch_scale` (0.75) are explicitly stated and match the JSON. The `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is correctly inferred as 0.0, and the `operation` as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" for creating the initial body.\\n\\n- Conclusion: The inferred components and values are consistent with the JSON.
