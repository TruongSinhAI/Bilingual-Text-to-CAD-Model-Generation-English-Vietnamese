This set of Euler angles is different from the one defined for the coordinate system and is not explicitly represented as a separate transformation step in the JSON's `part_1` structure.

The operation \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" also correctly corresponds to \\\"Create a new solid body\\\".\\n\\n-Correction: The description's \\\"Transform... using the euler angles (-90.0, 0.0, 0.0)\\\" is inconsistent with the `coordinate_system`'s Euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` present in the JSON. The JSON only defines one coordinate system per part, and this extra transformation detail is not reflected. Thus, the description does not perfectly match the JSON for this specific detail.\\n</think>"
