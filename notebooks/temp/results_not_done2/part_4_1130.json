Establishing the coordinate system with euler angles and a translation vector. 2. Defining a 2D sketch based on the provided loops and faces. 3. Transforming the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles and a translation vector. 4. Extruding or adding complexity to the 2D sketch to create a 3D model using given parameters. Each CAD part has key components and properties, including coordinate system, sketch, extrusion, and description information. - The coordinate system defines the 3D rotation and translation of the 2D sketch plane. - The sketch consists of faces, loops, and one or more curves such as lines, arcs, and circles. - The extrusion applies depth and scaling to the 3D model based on given parameters. - The description offers additional information about the CAD part, such as its shape, length, width, and height. In the subsequent tasks, provide detailed step-by-step natural language instructions for the remaining parts, assemble interconnected CAD parts while adhering to specific boolean operations to create the final CAD model.</description>",
