These circles will create a tapered effect. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch**: Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.3304. 4. **Extrude the 2D sketch**: Extrude the sketch by 0.7143 units towards the normal and 0.0 units in the opposite direction of the normal. This part forms the tapered top and bottom of the cylindrical object, having a height approximately three times its diameter with flat tops and bottoms. This part is joined to the first part to create the final cylindrical object. The final shape is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom, a flat base, and a slightly curved top, which is symmetrical along its central axis. The final dimensions of the object are as follows: * Length: The overall height of the object, equal to the sum of the extrusion depths of parts 1 and 2, is 0.75 units. * Width: The diameter of the base is approximately 0.771 units. * Height: The height of the object, as described in the flat top and bottom of part 1, is approximately 0.385 units.</description>",
