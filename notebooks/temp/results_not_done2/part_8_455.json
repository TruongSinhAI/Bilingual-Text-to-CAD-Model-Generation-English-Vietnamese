Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotations and no translation. **1.2** First, create the rectangular prism portion of the shape. Start by creating a new sketch on the XY plane. Draw a rectangle with corner points at (0,0) and (0.75, 0.25). Close the loop and exit the sketch. Extrude the sketch by 0.0938 units in the direction of the positive Z-axis. **1.3** Next, create the cylindrical hole on one side. Start by creating a new sketch on the XY plane. Draw a circle with its center at (0.125, 0.125) and a radius of 0.0312. Close the loop and exit the sketch. Create a new sketch on the side face of the prism where the circle should be. Use the first sketch as a reference to position the circle in the correct location. Extrude the circle through the thickness of the part. **1.4** The final dimensions of this part are 0.75 units in length, 0.75 units in width, and 0.0938 units in height. **1.5** The rectangular prism has four faces, each made up of a single loop. There are three lines in each loop, with the exceptions of the two cylindrical holes, which each have a single loop consisting of a single circle. **1.6** The first sketch (face_1) consists of three lines and two circles. The first line starts at (0,0) and ends at (0.75,0). The second line starts at (0.75,0) and ends at (0.75,0.25). The third line starts at (0.75,0.25) and ends at (0,0.25). The fourth line starts at (0,0.25) and ends at (0,0). The two circles are located at (0.125,0.125) and (0.625,0.125) with a radius of 0.0312. **1.7** This part represents the base of the final assembly and will not be combined with any other parts using boolean operations.</description>",
