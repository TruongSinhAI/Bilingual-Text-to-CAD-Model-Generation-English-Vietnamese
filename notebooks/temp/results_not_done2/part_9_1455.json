However, the provided JSON `sketch` object for `part_1` only contains `face_1` and completely omits any representation of `face_2`. A sketch typically resides on a 2D plane before extrusion, so a \\\"Face 2 on the Z-axis\\\" might be interpreted as a different sketch plane or a feature to be added later, but within the \\\"sketch\\\" object, the JSON clearly does not have it. This is a significant discrepancy.\\n-Check `extrusion`: All parameters (depths, scale, operation) match the values in the JSON.\\n--Result: The extrusion parameters are correct.\\n\\n-Overall Correction: Due to the presence of a detailed \\\"face_2\\\" in the description that is entirely absent from the \\\"sketch\\\" object in the JSON, the JSON does not fully match the description. This warrants a \\\"No\\\" validation.\\n</think>"
