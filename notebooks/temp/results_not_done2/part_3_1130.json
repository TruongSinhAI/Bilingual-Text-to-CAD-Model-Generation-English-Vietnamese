The lines should be defined as follows: 1. Line 1: Start point at [0.0, 0.0], end point at [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Line 2: Start point at [0.75, 0.0], end point at [0.75, 0.2812]. 3.

After creating the sketch, scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter, sketch\\\\_scale, which is set to 0.75. Now,, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translation vector (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) from the coordinate system. Next, extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model. Set the extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal to 0.0188 units and the extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal to 0.0 units.
