    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A long, rectangular, metallic object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) degrees and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.75, 0.0). Next, create the 2D sketch for this part. For this sketch, we will create a single face. This face will consist of six lines, which form a closed loop. Start by creating the first line (line\\\\_1) with a start point at (0.0, 0.0) and an end point at (0.0625, 0.0). Then, create a second line (line\\\\_2) with a start point at (0.0625, 0.0) and an end point at (0.0625, 0.0078). Follow this by creating a third line (line\\\\_3) with a start point at (0.0625, 0.0078) and an end point at (0.0078, 0.0078). Next, create a fourth line (line\\\\_4) with a start point at (0.0078, 0.0078) and an end point at (0.0078, 0.0625). Then, create a fifth line (line\\\\_5) with a start point at (0.0078, 0.0625) and an end point at (0.0, 0.0625). Lastly, create a sixth line (line\\\\_6) with a start point at (0.0, 0.0625) and an end point at (0.0, 0.0). Now, set the scaling parameter for the sketch. In this case, the scaling parameter is set to 0.0625. After scaling, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth is 0.75 towards the normal direction and 0.0 in the opposite direction. The final dimensions of this part are as follows: the length is 0.0625, the width is 0.75, and the height is 0.0625.</description>",
