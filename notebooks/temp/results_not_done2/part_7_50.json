Draw the following lines to form a rectangle (face_1): * line_1: 0.0, 0.0 to 0.3553, 0.0 (Bottom edge) * line_2: 0.3553, 0.0 to 0.3553, 0.3553 (Right edge) * line_3: 0.3553, 0.3553 to 0.0, 0.3553 (Top edge) * line_4: 0.0, 0.3553 to 0.0, 0.0 (Left edge) All loops should be closed. This loop (loop_1) has 4 lines. **Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Apply the following transformation parameters to the 2D sketch: * euler_angles: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 * translation_vector: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch with the following properties: * extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.75 * extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 * sketch_scale: 0.3553 * operation: Create a new solid body (NewBodyFeatureOperation)\\\\n</description>\\\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\\\n<think>\\\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\\\n\\\\nparts:\\\\n-part_1:\\\\n  -coordinate_system:\\\\n    -Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description: \\\\\"  \n    ,\n    \"euler angles 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0\\\\\"  \n    ,\n    \")\\\\n    -Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description: \\\\\"  \n    ,\n    \"translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\\\\\"  \n    ,\n    \")\\\\n  -sketch:\\\\n    -face_1:\\\\n      -loop_1:\\\\n        -line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.3553, 0.0] (from description)\\\\n        -line_2: Start [0.3553, 0.0], End [0.3553, 0.3553] (from description)\\\\n        -line_3: Start [0.3553, 0.3553], End [0.0, 0.3553] (from description)\\\\n        -line_4: Start [0.0, 0.3553], End [0.0, 0.0] (from description)\\\\n  -extrusion:\\\\n    -extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.75 (from description)\\\\n    -extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (from description)\\\\n    -sketch_scale: 0.3553 (from description)\\\\n    -operation: \\\\\"  \n    ,\n    \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\\\"  \n    ,\n    \" (from description: \\\\\"  \n    ,\n    \"Create a new solid body (NewBodyFeatureOperation)\\\\\"  \n    ,\n    \")\\\\n\\\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\\\n\\\\n-Check Coordinate System:\\\\n  -Euler Angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and Translation Vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] match the JSON perfectly.\\\\n\\\\n-Check Sketch (face_1, loop_1):\\\\n  -The four lines defining the rectangular loop are correctly specified with their Start and End Points, matching the JSON.
