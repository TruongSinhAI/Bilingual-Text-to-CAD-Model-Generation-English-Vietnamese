    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom, featuring a hole in the center of the top face** The first part is a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom. It has a hole in the center of the top face. **Coordinate System** Create a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles as (0, 0, -90) degrees and the translation vector as (0, 0, 0). This will position the sketch plane at the origin with a rotation of -90 degrees around the z-axis. **Sketch** Begin a new sketch on the xy-plane defined by the coordinate system. 1. Create a rectangle by drawing lines between: * Point (0, 0) and Point (0.75, 0) * Point (0.75, 0) and Point (0.75, 0.0625) * Point (0.75, 0.0625) and Point (0.5937, 0.0625) * Point (0.5937, 0.0625) and Point (0.5937, 0.25) * Point (0.5937, 0.25) and Point (0.5312, 0.25) * Point (0.5312, 0.25) and Point (0.4062, 0.125) * Point (0.4062, 0.125) and Point (0.4062, 0.0625) * Point (0.4062, 0.0625) and Point (0.3437, 0.0625) * Point (0.3437, 0.0625) and Point (0.3437, 0.125) * Point (0.3437, 0.125) and Point (0.2187, 0.25) * Point (0.2187, 0.25) and Point (0.1562, 0.25) * Point (0.1562, 0.25) and Point (0.1562, 0.0625) * Point (0.1562, 0.0625) and Point (0.0, 0.0625) * Point (0.0, 0.0625) and Point (0.0, 0.0) The rectangle forms the boundary of the part. 2. Create an ellipse in the center of the rectangle with diameters of 0.3437x0.1875 (~1/3x1/16) units. This represents the hole in the top face. Size the ellipse so that it is tangent to the lines of the rectangle, making sure the hole does not penetrate the top surface of the part. **Extrusion** Extrude the sketch from the top surface (opposite normal direction) by 0.375 units. This completes Part 1, with the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.375 units * Height: 0.75 units The part can now be used as a base or merged with other parts in the final assembly, depending on additional assembly instructions.</description>",

Since all \"\n                ,\"Center\"\n                ,\" points in the JSON are [x, y] format, it implies all sketches are on the XY plane of the *local* coordinate system.

Next, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Create a circle centered at [0.375, 0.375] with a radius of 0.375 on the XY plane. This forms loop 1, which is the only loop on face 1. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 3D sketch by a depth of 0.2083 towards the normal and 0.0 in the opposite direction. This completes the construction of the cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. **Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Flat Top and Bottom, Joined to Part 1** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.1167, 0.1167, 0.2083].
