    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Cylindrical Object with a Rectangular Hole** *Shape and Dimensions*: The first part is a cylindrical object with a rectangular hole in the center. The hole is slightly larger than the diameter of the cylinder. The object is symmetrical along its central axis, with a length, width, and height of approximately 0.75 units each. *Instructions*: 1. Create a new coordinate system with the specified Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translation vector (0.0, 0.0592, 0.0). This will position and orient the sketch plane for the first face. 2. For face 1, create a loop with the following curves: a. Line from (0.2209, 0.0) to (0.2209, 0.0044) b. Arc centered at (0.0636, 0.1617) from (0.2209, 0.0044) to (0.2209, 0.319) c. Line from (0.2209, 0.319) to (0.2209, 0.3235) d. Line from (0.2209, 0.3235) to (0.3714, 0.3235) e. Arc centered at (0.4418, 0.1617) from (0.3714, 0.3235) to (0.3714, 0.0) f. Line from (0.3714, 0.0) to (0.2209, 0.0) 3. Repeat step 2 for face 2 and face 3, using the specified coordinates for each curve. This will complete the 2D sketch for the first part. 4. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75, and transform it into a 3D sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector. 5. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.1371 units in the normal direction and 0 units in the opposite direction. This will create the first part of the final shape. **Part 2: Conical Object with Concentric Circles** *Shape and Dimensions*: The second part is a conical object with a series of concentric circles that define its shape. The object has a smoothly curved surface and is symmetrical along its central axis. The length, width, and height of the object are approximately 0.3146 units each. *Instructions*: 1. Create a new coordinate system with the specified Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translation vector (0.0636, 0.0636, 0.0). This will position and orient the sketch plane for the first face. 2. For face 1, create a loop with the following curves: a. Arc centered at (0.0, 0.1573) from (0.1573, 0.0) to (0.1573, 0.2795) b. Line from (0.1573, 0.2795) to (0.1573, 0.3146) c. Arc centered at (0.1573, 0.0351) from (0.1573, 0.3146) to (0.1573, 0.0) 3. Repeat step 2 for face 2, using the specified coordinates for each curve. This will complete the 2D sketch for the second part. 4. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.3146, and transform it into a 3D sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector. 5. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.2056 units in the normal direction and 0 units in the opposite direction. This will create the second part of the final shape.</description>",
