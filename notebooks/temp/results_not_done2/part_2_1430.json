The `JoinFeatureOperation` is a plausible operation for combining shapes, but the primary issue lies in the sketch definition not matching the description.\\n\\nCorrection: The JSON's sketch structure for `part_2` deviates significantly from the description, particularly with the introduction of `face_2` and an undocumented circle (Radius 0.2). To match the description, the JSON for `part_2.sketch` should ideally have only one face (e.g., `face_1`) containing both `loop_1` (lines+arc) and `loop_2` (circle with radius 0.08), and no circle with radius 0.2.\\n</think>"
