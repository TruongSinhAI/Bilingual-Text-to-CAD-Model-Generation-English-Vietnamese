    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners as the first part of the assembly. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0 degrees in all X, Y, and Z axes, and the translation vector to 0 in all axes as well. Sketching the Base 1. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. 2. Sketch a rectangle with vertices at (0, 0.25), (0.25, 0), (0.75, 0), and (0.75, 0.5), corresponding to the points provided in the JSON. 3. Close the loop by connecting the starting point, (0, 0.25), with a line to the endpoint, (0.75, 0.5), creating a complete face. The sketch should now have a single face consisting of five lines and four vertices. Scaling the Sketch 1. Apply a uniform scale of 0.75 to the sketch. This will scale down the sketch proportionately to the given factor. Transforming the Sketch into 3D and Extruding 1. Define the transformation using the euler\\\\_angles and translation\\\\_vector provided for the coordinate\\\\_system. Set the euler\\\\_angles to (0, 0, 0), and translation\\\\_vector to (0, 0, 0). 2. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.5 units. Part 2: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Create the second part of the assembly, a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Sketching the Base 1. Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. 2. Draw a rectangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0.25, 0), (0.25, 0.5), and (0, 0.5). This corresponds to the vertices in the JSON for this part. 3. Close the loop by connecting the first and last vertices, (0, 0) and (0, 0.5), to create a complete face consisting of four lines. Scaling the Sketch 1. Apply a uniform scale of 0.5 to the sketch. Transforming the Sketch into 3D and Recessing 1. Define the transformation using the euler\\\\_angles and translation\\\\_vector provided for the coordinate\\\\_system. Set the euler\\\\_angles to (0, 0, 0), and translation\\\\_vector to (0.5, 0, 0.5). The Z-axis should point from bottom to top. 2. Instead of extruding, create a feature by recessing the rectangle along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.25 units towards the negative Z direction, creating a recess in the base part. Final Assembly After creating Parts 1 and 2, assemble them according to their specified operations (NewBodyFeatureOperation and CutFeatureOperation) to complete the three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The final shape should have the following dimensions, as specified in the given JSON: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 * Height (with taper): approx. 0.875</description>",
