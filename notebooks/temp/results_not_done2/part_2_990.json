Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch 2.1. Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the defined coordinate system. 2.2. Draw the first line from (0.0531, 0.0) to (0.4027, 0.3422). 2.3. Draw the second line from (0.4027, 0.3422) to (0.4027, 0.4004). 2.4. Draw the third line from (0.4027, 0.4004) to (0.4202, 0.4004). 2.5.

Draw the sixth line from (0.4027, 0.6917) to (0.4027, 0.75). 2.8. Create an arc that starts at (0.4027, 0.75), has a midpoint at (0, 0.4812), and ends at (0.0531, 0.0). Step 3: Transform the 2D Sketch into 3D 3.1. Since this is a prism, simply extrude the sketch along the Z-axis with a depth of 0.1457 towards the normal and 0 depth opposite the normal. Apply a scale factor of 0.75 to the sketch before extrusion. Step 4: Extrude the Sketch into a 3D Model 4.1. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis with a depth of 0.1457 towards the normal. Final Result Follow the steps above to create a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a tapered shape, narrowing slightly towards the top. The sides of the prism are parallel to each other, with dimensions as follows: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.1457 - Height: 0.75</description>",
