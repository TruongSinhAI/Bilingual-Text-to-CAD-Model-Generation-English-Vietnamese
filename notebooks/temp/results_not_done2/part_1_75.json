The object is symmetrical along its central axis. The length, width, and height of this part are 0.7191 meters, 0.4272 meters, and 0.7191 meters respectively. *Instructions* 1. **Create the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector [0.1019, 0.4272, 0.0309]. 2. **Draw the 2D sketch** On the X-Y plane of the created coordinate system, draw a 2D sketch. This sketch resides on face 1 of the part. 3. **Create loops and curves** Loop 1 of face 1 will be constructed with two arcs. Arc 1 will start at point [0.0, 0.601], go through point [0.1327, 0.668], and end at point [0.2723, 0.7191]. Arc 2 will start at point [0.2723, 0.7191], go through point [0.4223, 0.0], and end at point [0.0, 0.601]. 4. **Scale the sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.7191, using the sketch scaling parameter. 5. **Transform 2D sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D, using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. 6. **Extrude the sketch** Extrude the sketch along its normal vector by a distance of 0.4272 meters. Set the opposite-normal extrude distance to 0.0 meters. Use the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" boolean operation. This completes the instructions for Part 1. The provided JSON does not include a Part 2. Therefore, I cannot provide instructions for it. However, the format would be similar to Part 1, starting with the following sentence: Construct <shape for Part 2 describing the overall shape> with <dimensions separated by commas>. Begin by creating a new coordinate system and proceed with the detailed step-by-step instructions to build that part, similar to the format of Part 1.</description>",

The sides of the prism are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Creating the coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of (0, 0, 0) and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0). This will establish the origin and orientation of the coordinate system for the first part. Drawing the 2D sketch Next, draw the 2D sketch for the first part. To do this, create a new sketch on the X-Y plane and follow these steps: 1. Draw the first line starting at (0, 0) and ending at (0.75, 0). 2. Draw the second line starting at (0.75, 0) and ending at (0.75, 0.2647). 3. Draw the third line starting at (0.75, 0.2647) and ending at (0, 0.2647). 4. Draw the fourth line starting at (0, 0.2647) and ending at (0, 0). These four lines form a rectangle on the X-Y plane. Adding a circle to the 2D sketch Now, add a circle to the 2D sketch: 1. Set the center of the circle at (0.375, 0.1324). 2. Set the radius of the circle to 0.0882. Scaling the 2D sketch Next, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 to reduce its size. Transforming the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Now, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector, which are (0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 0), respectively. This will maintain the original position and orientation of the 2D sketch. Extruding the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.4412 units, creating the 3D model for the first part.
