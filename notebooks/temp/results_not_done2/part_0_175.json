Set the operation to \"Create a new solid body.\" Review the object dimensions * The shape has the following dimensions: + Length: 0.0997 + Width: 0.0997 + Height: 0.7181 Extra Information (Optional) The generated parametric CAD model is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom. The cylinder is centered and stands upright. The top and bottom ends are flat and parallel to each other. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. The 2D sketch consists of one circle on the X-Y plane. The circle is centered at [0.0499, 0.0499] with a radius of 0.0499. The sketch is then scaled by a factor of 0.0997. The scaled sketch is subsequently transformed into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. The transformed sketch is extruded to create the 3D model. The final shape is created by extruding the sketch by 0.7181 units in the normal direction and 0 units in the opposite direction. The operation is set to \"Create a new solid body.\" The final shape has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.0997 * Width: 0.0997 * Height: 0.7181</description>",
