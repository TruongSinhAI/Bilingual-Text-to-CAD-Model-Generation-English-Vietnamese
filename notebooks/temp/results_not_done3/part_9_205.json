Step 3: Create Faces and Loops Create a face on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Within this face, create a loop using the following lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.625] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.625], End Point [0.0, 0.625] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.625], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Step 4: Scale the Sketch Scale the drawn sketch by a factor of 0.75. Step 5: Extrude the Sketch Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model with the following parameters: - Extrusion Depth Towards Normal: 0.5 - Extrusion Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 - Sketch Scale: 0.75 This process will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The front face is angled at 45 degrees from the top and bottom faces, and the sides are parallel to each other and the top and bottom faces. The object is centered on a white background. The dimensions (length, width, and height) of the part are 0.75 x 0.5 x 0.75. Part 2: Additional Parts (If Applicable) (Note: If there are additional parts in the CAD Assembly JSON, repeat the process as described above for each part, detailing the shape, dimensions, and construction process.) Final Shape The final CAD model consists of the intermediate parts constructed according to the provided JSON. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, an angled front face, and parallel sides. The shape is centered on a white background. The dimensions (length, width, and height) of the final model are determined by the dimensions of the individual parts and their position in the final assembly.</description>",
