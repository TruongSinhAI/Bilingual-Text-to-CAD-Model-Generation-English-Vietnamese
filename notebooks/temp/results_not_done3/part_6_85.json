Excluding the four corner points of the smaller rectangle (two on each side), create four arcs between each pair of adjacent lines on the smaller rectangle. Each arc should be centered at the midpoint between the line's endpoints. 5. With the smaller rectangle completely removed by the four arcs, you now have a 2D sketch containing a rectangular prism with a circular hole. 3D Sketch 1. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 2.
