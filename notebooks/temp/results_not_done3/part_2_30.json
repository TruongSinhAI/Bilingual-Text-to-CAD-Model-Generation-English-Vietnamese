This will serve as the reference for our first CAD part. **Sketching the profile:** We will now proceed to draw the 2D sketch that will define the profile of the prism. The sketch is drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1) with a single loop (loop\\\\_1) that traces out the perimeter of the prism's profile. The loop consists of 12 line segments (line\\\\_1 to line\\\\_12) arranged in a rectangular shape with slightly tapered sides, narrowing slightly towards the center. - line\\\\_1: Start Point: 0.0, 0.0; End Point: 0.04, 0.0 - line\\\\_2: Start Point: 0.04, 0.0; End Point: 0.04, 0.005 - line\\\\_3: Start Point: 0.04, 0.005; End Point: 0.025, 0.005 - line\\\\_4: Start Point: 0.025, 0.005; End Point: 0.025, 0.045 - line\\\\_5: Start Point: 0.025, 0.045; End Point: 0.04, 0.045 - line\\\\_6: Start Point: 0.04, 0.045; End Point: 0.04, 0.05 - line\\\\_7: Start Point: 0.04, 0.05; End Point: 0.0, 0.05 - line\\\\_8: Start Point: 0.0, 0.05; End Point: 0.0, 0.045 - line\\\\_9: Start Point: 0.0, 0.045; End Point: 0.015, 0.045 - line\\\\_10: Start Point: 0.015, 0.045; End Point: 0.015, 0.005 - line\\\\_11: Start Point: 0.015, 0.005; End Point: 0.0, 0.005 - line\\\\_12: Start Point: 0.0, 0.005; End Point: 0.0, 0.0 **Extruding the 2D sketch to 3D model:** Now that we have our 2D sketch, we need to convert it into a 3D model. This requires us to extrude the sketch along the z-axis by a distance of 0.75. Additionally, no materials will be removed or added at this stage. The final part has a length of 0.05, a width of 0.05, and a height of 0.75. The height is determined by the extrusion depth specified in the extrusion properties. The scale parameter for the sketch is 0.05. This means that all dimensions and distances used in the sketch should be multiplied by 0.05 to obtain their real-world values. **Part complete:** With these steps completed, our first CAD part - a long, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom - is now ready. The part is oriented according to the specified coordinate system, has the specified dimensions, and retains all original details.</description>",
