    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Creating the Base of the Model The model begins with a 2D sketch of a rectangular shape on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The shape is constructed as follows: 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles (0°, 0°, -90°) and translation vector (0, 0.5, 0). 2. Create face_1 of the sketch. 3. Starting from point (0, 0), create line_1 and extend it to point (0.75, 0). 4. Starting from point (0.75, 0), create line_2 and extend it to point (0.75, 0.25). 5. Starting from point (0.75, 0.25), create line_3 and extend it to point (0, 0.25). 6. Starting from point (0, 0.25), create line_4 and extend it to point (0, 0). These lines form a closed loop. Now, we will proceed to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by extruding it. The 3D sketch has the following properties: 1. Extrusion depth towards the normal is set to 0.5 units. 2. Extrusion depth opposite normal is set to 0 units. 3. Sketch scale is set to 0.75 units. 4. The operation is defined as NewBodyFeatureOperation, which creates a new solid body. Part 2: Adding a Tapered Top to the Model Now that the base is created, we will add a slightly tapered top to the model. The process is similar to creating the base, except for the addition of a second face to the sketch: 1. Preserve the existing coordinate system: euler angles (0°, 0°, -90°) and translation vector (0, 0.5, 0). 2. Create a second face of the sketch (face_2). 3. Starting from point (0, 0.25), create line_1 and extend it to point (0.75, 0.25). 4. Starting from point (0.75, 0.25), create line_2 and extend it to point (0.75, 0.625). 5. Starting from point (0.75, 0.625), create line_3 and extend it to point (0.5, 0.625). 6. Continue with line_4, and extend it from point (0.5, 0.625) to point (0.5, 0.5273). 7. Create line_5 from point (0.5, 0.5273) to point (0.25, 0.5273). 8. Extend line_6 from point (0.25, 0.5273) to point (0.25, 0.625). 9. Complete the loop by extending line_7 from point (0.25, 0.625) to point (0, 0.625). 10. Finally, create line_8 from point (0, 0.625) to point (0, 0.25) to close the loop. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using similar parameters as the base extrusion, but set the operation to JoinFeatureOperation, which will add the tapered section to the previously constructed part. By following these instructions, you will obtain the final shape, which is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel, meeting at right angles, and with dimensions 2 units by 3 units by 4 units.</description>",
