    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Simple Rectangular Prism** The first part is a simple rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The front face is angled at 45 degrees. We will create this part in four steps: creating a coordinate system, drawing a 2D sketch, extruding the sketch into 3D, and defining the final shape. **Step 1: Create a coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.375]. This will position and orient the 2D sketch plane for the part. **Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch** On the sketch plane, create a new face (face_1) and draw a closed loop (loop_1) consisting of five lines: 1. line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0054], End Point [0.0088, 0.0] 2. line_2: Start Point [0.0088, 0.0], End Point [0.023, 0.0033] 3. line_3: Start Point [0.023, 0.0033], End Point [0.0232, 0.0215] 4. line_4: Start Point [0.0232, 0.0215], End Point [0.0055, 0.0229] 5. line_5: Start Point [0.0055, 0.0229], End Point [0.0, 0.0054] This loop forms the perimeter of the rectangular prism's base. **Step 3: Extrude the sketch into 3D** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by 0.1875 units and in the opposite direction by 0.1875 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.0232. This will create a 3D solid representing the rectangular prism. **Step 4: Define the final shape** The final shape is a simple, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The front face is angled at 45 degrees, making the length and width equal to 0.0232 units, and the height is 0.375 units. Here is a summary of the part: * Shape: Simple, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a 45-degree angle on the front face * Length: 0.0232 units * Width: 0.0232 units * Height: 0.375 units</description>",

Arc connects (0.1424, 0.5883) to (0.1424, 0.0) with midpoint (0.0, 0.2942). This defines a semi-circular profile.\\n    - Face 2, Loop 1: Line connects (0.1424, 0.0) to (0.1424, 0.5883). Arc connects (0.1424, 0.5883) to (0.1424, 0.0) with midpoint (0.75, 0.2942). This defines another semi-circular profile, mirrored across the Y-axis relative to Face 1 if the lines were the same. The sketch logic is consistent with the JSON.\\n  - Extrusion: Depths (0.3046 towards, 0.0 opposite) and scale (0.75) match. \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" is appropriate for the first part.\\n\\n- Part 2:\\n  - Coordinate system: Euler Angles and Translation Vector match.\\n  - Sketch: One face with a single loop composed of six lines.\\n    - Line 1: (0.0, 0.1161) -> (0.1672, 0.0)\\n    - Line 2: (0.1672, 0.0) -> (0.3514, 0.0868)\\n    - Line 3: (0.3514, 0.0868) -> (0.3683, 0.2897)\\n    - Line 4: (0.3683, 0.2897) -> (0.2011, 0.4058)\\n    - Line 5: (0.2011, 0.4058) -> (0.0169, 0.319)\\n    - Line 6: (0.0169, 0.319) -> (0.0, 0.1161)\\n    The lines form a closed hexagonal shape. The description mentions \\\"Rectangular Prism\\\" but the sketch defines a hexagon, which is a discrepancy in naming for the part's general shape, but the specific sketch details match the JSON.\\n  - Extrusion: Depths (0.4142 towards, 0.0 opposite) and scale (0.4058) match. The description explicitly states \\\"connected to a rectangular prism\\\" in the removed text, which strongly supports a \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" to combine this new body with Part 1.\\n\\n- Correction: The overall shape naming \\\"Rectangular Prism\\\" for Part 2 in the description is inconsistent with the hexagonal sketch points, but the geometry in the JSON matches the provided sketch points exactly. The operation \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" is a correct inference based on the overall description of the final CAD object. No corrections are needed for the JSON itself, only a note on the description's naming convention for Part 2.\\n</think>"
