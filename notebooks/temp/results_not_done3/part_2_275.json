    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Curved Side The first part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The prism is centered on the white background. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the curved side is perpendicular to both. The length of the curved side is approximately twice the length of the top and bottom faces. The model is symmetrical along the center line. Sketch 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 2. Begin a new sketch on the XY plane. 3. Draw arc 1, starting at point [0.0, 0.0077], with a midpoint of [0.0023, 0.0023], and ending at point [0.0077, 0.0]. 4.
