This type of transform is typically part of the initial coordinate system definition for the part in the JSON, or implicit in the extrusion, not a separate field within the extrusion block. The JSON structure for this part only defines the coordinate system once at the part level, and does not have a redundant transformation in the extrusion section.

In the JSON, 'face_1' 'loop_1' only contains the circle with radius 0.375. The circle with radius 0.2812 is instead placed in 'face_1' 'loop_2' in the JSON, indicating a structural mismatch between the description and the JSON for 'face_1' loops.\\n- Similar to Part 1, the description for Part 2 also includes a \"\n           , \"Transform both scaled 2D sketches into 3D\"\n           , \" step which is not represented in the JSON structure for extrusion.\\n\\n--Result: Due to the `operation` mismatch in Part 1's extrusion and the structural mismatch in Part 2's sketch definition (specifically, the placement of the second circle within `face_1`), the description does not fully match the JSON.\\n</think>"
