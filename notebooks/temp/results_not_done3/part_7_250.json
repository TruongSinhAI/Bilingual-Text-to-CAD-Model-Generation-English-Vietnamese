    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A Long, Thin, Cylindrical Object with a Slightly Tapered End** **Step 1: Create the Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) degrees.

The sketch should consist of a single face (face\\\\_1). **Step 3: Draw the Loops and Curves** Within face\\\\_1, draw a loop (loop\\\\_1) that consists of four straight lines. The lines are defined as follows: - line\\\\_1: Start Point = (0.0, 0.0), End Point = (0.0312, 0.0) - line\\\\_2: Start Point = (0.0312, 0.0), End Point = (0.0312, 0.0112) - line\\\\_3: Start Point = (0.0312, 0.0112), End Point = (0.0112, 0.0112) - line\\\\_4: Start Point = (0.0112, 0.0112), End Point = (0.0, 0.0) **Step 4: Scale the Sketch** Scale the sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.0312. **Step 5: Transform the Sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. For this, use the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 6: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal direction by 0.75 units. This will create the final 3D model. **Additional Details** The length of this part is 0.0312 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0312 units. The shape of this part is a long, thin, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end. The tapered end is a result of the sketch's shape and the extrusion depth.</description>",
