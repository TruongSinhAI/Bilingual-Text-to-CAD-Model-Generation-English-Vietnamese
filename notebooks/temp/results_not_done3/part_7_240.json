    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with an Offset Smaller Rectangular Prism Construct a rectangular prism with a smaller offset rectangular prism. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin. Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]. This will position and orient the sketch plane accordingly. Sketching the First Face (Face 1) Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Start by drawing a rectangle composed of six straight lines forming a closed loop. 1. Move to point (0.0, 0.0): `G0 X0.0 Y0.0` 2. Draw a line from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0): `L0.75 0.0` 3.

The loop is closed by connecting the final point with the starting point. Scaling the Sketch Scale the sketch using the scaling factor specified in the CAD assembly JSON. Let's say the scaling factor is 0.75, which means we will downsize the sketch. Move the cursor to the center of the sketch and enter the scaling factor `S0.75`. Click in the sketch to apply the scaling.

Enter the `E` command (Extrude) and input `0.375` to determine the depth to extrude. Part 1 Complete - Continue to Next Part or Final Shape With the first part completed, you can now proceed with creating the next part(s) or the final shape. Follow the same pattern as shown here, outlining the respectiveShape, Creating a New Coordinate System, Sketching the Face(s), Scaling, Transforming the Sketch into 3D, and Extruding the Sketch.
