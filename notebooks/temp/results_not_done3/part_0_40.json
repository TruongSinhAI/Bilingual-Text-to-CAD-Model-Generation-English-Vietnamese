However, the JSON's `face_1` contains *two* loops (`loop_1` and `loop_2`), where `loop_2` defines the inner boundary of the hollow object. The description completely omits any mention or details of this second loop. This is a significant mismatch in the sketch definition.\\n- Extrusion Parameters: `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0131), `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0), `sketch_scale` (0.75), and `operation` ('NewBodyFeatureOperation') are all consistent with the explicit statements in the description. Correct for parameters that are mentioned.\\n- Correction: The most critical discrepancy is the missing description of `loop_2` in the sketch. The description only details one loop, while the JSON clearly defines two. To fully match the JSON, the description needs to include details for the inner loop (`loop_2`).\\n</think>"
