On this face, create loop 1 using a circle centered at (0.15, 0.15) with a radius of 0.15. Next, create loop 2 also on the same face, using another circle centered at (0.15, 0.15) with a radius of 0.078. **Sketching the Side:** Create a new face for the side view. On this face, create loop 1 using a circle centered at (0.15, 0.6) with a radius of 0.15. Then, create loop 2 also on the same face, using another circle centered at (0.15, 0.6) with a radius of 0.078. **Sketching the Other Side:** Create another new face for the other side view. On this face, create loop 1 using a circle centered at (0.6, 0.15) with a radius of 0.15. Then, create loop 2 also on the same face, using another circle centered at (0.6, 0.15) with a radius of 0.078. **Sketching the Top:** Create a final new face for the top view. On this face, create loop 1 using a circle centered at (0.6, 0.6) with a radius of 0.15. Then, create loop 2 also on the same face, using another circle centered at (0.6, 0.6) with a radius of 0.078. **Extruding the Sketch:** Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.18 units, and in the opposite direction by 0 units. Apply a sketch scale of 0.75. This will create a new solid body. The length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.18 units.</description>",
