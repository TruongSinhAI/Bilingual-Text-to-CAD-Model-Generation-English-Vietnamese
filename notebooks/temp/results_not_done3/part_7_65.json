This will serve as the basis for drawing the 2D sketch of the prism. 2. **Draw the 2D sketch for the prism.** On the X-Y plane, draw a rectangle using four lines. One line should start at (0, 0) and end at (0.75, 0), another should start at (0.75, 0) and end at (0.75, 0.435), the third should start at (0.75, 0.435) and end at (0, 0.435), and the final line should start at (0, 0.435) and return to the origin at (0, 0). Remark: The sketch consists of four lines, with a single rectangular face (face_1) resulting from the closed loop formed by these lines. 3. **Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D model.** Rotate the sketch around the Z-axis by 45 degrees (euler\\\\_angles: [0, 0, 45]), while maintaining the current flat top and bottom surfaces, and then translate the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.1875 units (translation\\\\_vector: [0, 0, 0.1875]). 4. **Extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model.** Extend face_1 by 0.1875 units in the direction opposite the normal (extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal: 0.1875) and leave the towards\\\\_normal depth at 0 (extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal: 0).
