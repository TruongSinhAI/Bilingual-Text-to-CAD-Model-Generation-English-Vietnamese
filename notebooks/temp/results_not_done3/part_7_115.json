Begin by creating a new coordinate system according to the provided parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.45, 0.0] Next, create a new sketch with this coordinate system. This sketch will be constructed on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch for face_1 consists of the following curves and loops: 1. line_1: * Start Point: [0.0, 0.0] * End Point: [0.1125, 0.0] 2. line_2: * Start Point: [0.1125, 0.0] * End Point: [0.1125, 0.75] 3. line_3: * Start Point: [0.1125, 0.75] * End Point: [0.0, 0.75] 4. line_4: * Start Point: [0.0, 0.75] * End Point: [0.0, 0.6] 5. line_5: * Start Point: [0.0, 0.6] * End Point: [0.0562, 0.6] 6. line_6: * Start Point: [0.0562, 0.6] * End Point: [0.0562, 0.45] 7. line_7: * Start Point: [0.0562, 0.45] * End Point: [0.0, 0.45] 8. line_8: * Start Point: [0.0, 0.45] * End Point: [0.0, 0.0] There are three loops in this sketch on face_1: 1. The first loop consists of line_1, line_2, and line_3 in sequence. 2. The second loop consists of line_4, an arc (created using center point [0.0562, 0.6] and radius 0.0438) and line_5 in sequence. 3. The third loop consists of this arc, line_6, line_7, and line_8 in sequence. Each loop is closed, and no loop consists of both a line and a circle, or an arc and a circle, as required by the constraints. Once the 2D sketch is complete, let's proceed to scale the sketch by 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified Euler angles and translation vector. Extrude this sketch to generate the 3D model for the first part: * extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.45 * extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 * sketch_scale: 0.75 Since no preceding CAD models exist, we create a new solid body. * operation: NewBodyFeatureOperation The resulting part will have dimensions as follows: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.45 * Height: 0.75</description>",
