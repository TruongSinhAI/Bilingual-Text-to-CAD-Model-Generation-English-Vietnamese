However, the JSON has `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 1.0302`. This is a direct contradiction. If it's a positive Z extrusion and the normal is positive Z, it should be `towards_normal`. If the intention was to cut *opposite* to the normal (negative Z), the description should have specified \\\"negative Z-axis\\\" or \\\"opposite direction\\\".\\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The `sketch_scale` (0.2943) is present in the JSON but not explicitly mentioned in the description for Part 4.\\n\\n-   **Conclusion:** The description contains a number of missing `sketch_scale` values and a direct contradiction in the extrusion direction for Part 4 compared to the JSON. Therefore, the description does not perfectly match the JSON.\\n</think>"

Now, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Step 2: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.0183. This scaling factor is provided in the 'sketch\\\\_scale' property of the CAD assembly JSON. Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Apply the rotation and translation defined by the 'Euler Angles' and 'Translation Vector' in the coordinate system property of the CAD assembly JSON to the 2D sketch. This would transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. Step 4: Extrude the 3D sketch Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.75 units along the direction normal to the sketch plane.
