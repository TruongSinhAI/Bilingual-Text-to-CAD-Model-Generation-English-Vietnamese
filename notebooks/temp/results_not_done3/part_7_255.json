The two 3D parts can now be combined according to their respective boolean operations to form the final shape. The shape of each part can be inferred from the `description` field in the CAD assembly JSON. The dimensions of the parts are as follows: * Part 1 dimensions: length = 0.75, width = 0.0352, height = 0.75 * Part 2 dimensions: length = 0.5938, width = 0.0352, height = 0.5938. The final shape is a simple, two-dimensional, rectangular shape with a central vertical line and a horizontal line intersecting it. The dimensions of the final shape can be calculated as the sum or difference of the dimensions of the individual parts, depending on their boolean operations.</description>",
