The height of the prism is approximately twice the width of the base. The width of the base is about the same as the height of the cylindrical base. The top and bottom of the prism are parallel to each other. The prism is centered in the image. - Shape: Simple rectangular prism with cylindrical bases - Length: 0.0375 m - Width: 0.75 m - Height: 0.0375 m Note: This intermediate part will serve as the base for further operations with subsequent parts.</description>",
