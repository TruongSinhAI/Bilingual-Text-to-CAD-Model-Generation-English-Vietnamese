    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Curved Top Edge Construct a rectangular prism with a curved top edge. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of multiple lines and one curved line, forming a closed loop. 1. Line 1: Draw a line segment from 0.0, 0.0354 to 0.0, 0.7146 on the X-axis. 2. Line 2: Draw a line segment from 0.0, 0.7146 to 0.0295, 0.7146 on the Y-axis. 3. Line 3: Draw a line segment from 0.0295, 0.7146 to 0.0295, 0.75 on the X-axis. 4. Line 4: Draw a line segment from 0.0295, 0.75 to 0.1476, 0.75 on the Y-axis. 5. Line 5: Draw a line segment from 0.1476, 0.75 to 0.1476, 0.7146 on the X-axis. 6. Line 6: Draw a line segment from 0.1476, 0.7146 to 0.1772, 0.7146 on the Y-axis. 7. Line 7: Draw a line segment from 0.1772, 0.7146 to 0.1772, 0.0354 on the X-axis. 8. Line 8: Draw a line segment from 0.1772, 0.0354 to 0.1476, 0.0354 on the Y-axis. 9. Line 9: Draw a line segment from 0.1476, 0.0354 to 0.1476, 0.0 on the X-axis. 10. Line 10: Draw a line segment from 0.1476, 0.0 to 0.0295, 0.0 on the Y-axis. 11. Line 11: Draw a line segment from 0.0295, 0.0 to 0.0295, 0.0354 on the X-axis. 12. Curved line 12: Draw a curved line with a radius of 0.0354 starting at 0.0, 0.0354 and ending at 0.0, 0.7146 on the Y-axis. This sketch forms a single loop with 12 curves - 11 line segments and 1 curved line. The loop is closed and does not have any circles or arcs. The shape of the loop is rectangular with a curved top edge, as specified in the description. Now, scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the coordinate system properties - euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model with an extrusion depth of 0.0354 towards the normal and an extrusion depth of 0.0 towards the opposite direction of the normal. This completes the construction of the rectangular prism with a curved top edge, which forms the first part of the CAD assembly. The part has a length of 0.75, a width of 0.75, and a height of 0.0354. Note that the operation for integrating this part with preceding CAD models is a \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", indicating that it results in the creation of a new solid body. However, the specifics of the operation will be handled in the overall CAD system and are not required for these instructions. Confidence: 90%</description>",
