Transform 2D Sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system defined earlier. Extrude the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.3542 units to create a 3D solid. The operation is a \"New Body Feature Operation\". Describe the Part The part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. The length is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.3542 units.</description>",
