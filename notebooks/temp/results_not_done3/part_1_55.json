    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate CAD Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Sloped Side** Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The sloped side is at a 45 degree angle. Start by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.1788, 0.0104]. Create a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single rectangular face (face_1) with a loop (loop_1). The loop contains four lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4). Here are the details: - line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - line_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0162] - line_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.0162], End Point [0.0, 0.0162] - line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0162], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.1673 units to generate the 3D model. **Intermediate CAD Part 2: Stacked Rectangular Prisms** Construct a CAD model of a rectangular prism with a series of rectangular prisms stacked on top of each other, with the topmost prism angled to the left. Start by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.1788, 0.2279]. Create a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of three rectangular faces (face_1, face_2, and face_3) with a loop on each face. Each loop contains four lines. Here are the details: Face 1: - line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - line_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0162] - line_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.0162], End Point [0.0, 0.0162] - line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0162], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Face 2: - line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.2175], End Point [0.6346, 0.2175] - line_2: Start Point [0.6346, 0.2175], End Point [0.6346, 0.2337] - line_3: Start Point [0.6346, 0.2337], End Point [0.0, 0.2337] - line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.2337], End Point [0.0, 0.2175] Face 3: - line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.435], End Point [0.6346, 0.435] - line_2: Start Point [0.6346, 0.435], End Point [0.6346, 0.4512] - line_3: Start Point [0.6346, 0.4512], End Point [0.0, 0.4512] - line_4: Start Point [0.0,</description>",
