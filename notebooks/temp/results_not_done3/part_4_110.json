Step 3: Create the rectangular prism loop 1. Draw line 1 from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.6429, 0.0]. 2. Draw line 2 from point [0.6429, 0.0] to point [0.6429, 0.4286]. 3.

Set the center of the circle to [0.3214, 0.2143], and give it a radius of 0.1071. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model 1. Extrude the rectangular prism loop by 0.1071 units in the positive Z direction. 2. Extrude the cylindrical hole loop by 0.1071 units in the positive Z direction. Step 6: Combine the parts (using a New Body operation) Combine the extruded loops, resulting in a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The hole is slightly larger than the prism's width and positioned at a slight angle, with the hole facing the viewer. The dimensions are approximately 2 units by 3 units by 4 units (including the cylindrical hole). The cylindrical hole has a diameter of ~1 unit. Height: 0.4286 Width: 0.6429 Length: 2 With these instructions, your junior CAD designer should be able to create an accurate CAD model of part 1, which is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The model dimensions are approximately 2 units by 3 units by 4 units, including the cylindrical hole. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of about 1 unit. The model is created at a slight angle, with the hole facing the viewer.</description>",
