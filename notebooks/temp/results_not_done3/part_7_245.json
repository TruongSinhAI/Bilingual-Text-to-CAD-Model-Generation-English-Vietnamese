Step 3: Create the first face of the prism 1. Create the first line with a start point at [0.0, 0.0] and an end point at [0.2812, 0.0]. 2. Create the second line with a start point at [0.2812, 0.0] and an end point at [0.2812, 0.75]. 3. Create the third line with a start point at [0.2812, 0.75] and an end point at [0.0, 0.75]. 4. Create the fourth line with a start point at [0.0, 0.75] and an end point at [0.0, 0.0]. These four lines form a closed loop, which makes up the first face of the prism. The loop consists of 4 lines. Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch Using the sketch_scale parameter, scale the entire 2D sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.75. Step 5: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Rotate the scaled 2D sketch using the euler angles specified in the coordinate system and translate the sketch with the specified translation vector. Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to create a 3D model with the dimensions provided in the description. Step 7: Complete the part The final shape of this part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. Its dimensions are approximately 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. The description also contains the length, width, and height of this part. Note: - The shape and dimensions are provided in the description for reference, which are inferred from a VLM model. - Do not assume any specific boolean operation terms like 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation', etc., to describe the boolean operation of the current part with the previous part. Instead, use their natural language descriptions. - Follow the instructions without adding any additional assumptions.</description>",
