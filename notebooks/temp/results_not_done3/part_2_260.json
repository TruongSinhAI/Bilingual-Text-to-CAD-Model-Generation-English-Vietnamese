Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the obtained coordinate system. Extrude the sketch, resulting in a 0.0625 depth extrusion along the normal direction and no extrusion in the opposite direction. This ends up with a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a pointed top. Part 2: Construct a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Create a new coordinate system using the following information: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0625, 0.3827] Now, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the established coordinate system.
