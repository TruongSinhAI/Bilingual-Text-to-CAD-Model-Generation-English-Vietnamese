Create the first face of the sketch by drawing a circle with a center at (0.195, 0.195) and a radius of 0.195. This will form loop 1.

Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.75 towards the normal and a depth of 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal, resulting in a solid, three-dimensional cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The length, width, and height of this part are all 0.39, 0.39, and 0.75 units respectively. **Part 2 and Generation of Final Shape** (Since there is no information provided for part 2, I am assuming the task is to add a base to the cylindrical object generated in part 1) Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, -0.39, 0.0. Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. Draw a circle with a center at (0.195, 0.195) and a radius of 0.39. This will form the base of the final shape. Scale the sketch by a factor of 1. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the new coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.39 towards the negative Z direction for creating the base. Perform a JoinFeatureOperation between the cylindrical object generated in part 1 and the base created in this part. The final shape will be a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom and a flat base.
