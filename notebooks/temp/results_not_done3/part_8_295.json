Now, we will scale the 2D sketch using the sketch\\\\_scale scaling parameter with a value of 0.75. Next, we will transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Finally, we will extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.0033 and an extrusion depth opposite the normal of 0.0. The sketch scale for the extrusion is also 0.75.
