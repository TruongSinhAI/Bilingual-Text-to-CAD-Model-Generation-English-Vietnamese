Step 4: Constrain the Loops * Loop 1: Close the loop by connecting the ending point of Line 6 to the starting point of Line 1. Step 5: Scale the Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.5833. Step 6: Transform the Sketch into 3D Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Step 7: Extrude the Sketch Extrude the sketch along its normal direction by 0.75 units.

Now, set the sketch scale to 0.75 and extrude the sketch by a distance of 0.75 towards the normal to complete part 1. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The dimensions of part 1 are as follows: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.75 **Part 2: Cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom** Create a new coordinate system with the euler angles set to 0 degrees, and a translation vector of [0.3125, 0.3125, 0].
