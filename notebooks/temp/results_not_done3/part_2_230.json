Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D object by extruding it along the normal direction by a distance of 0.75, and in the opposite direction by a distance of 0. The height of this intermediate part is 0.5893 and the width is 0.75. This part will serve as the base for subsequent parts. The boolean operation for this part is the creation of a new solid body. Note: For subsequent parts, start by transforming the previous part's coordinate system to the current part's coordinate system, then add or remove material as required. Each part's description should contain the shape, length, width, and height as provided in the JSON.</description>",
