    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three Circles Formation Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.1667, 0.0] Sketch Create a sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of nine faces, each containing one circular loop. Here's the breakdown: Face 1 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.1042, 0.4792] - Radius: 0.1042 Face 2 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.1042, 0.0625] - Radius: 0.0625 Face 3 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.1042, 0.6875] - Radius: 0.0625 Face 4 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.0739, 0.6104] - Radius: 0.0208 Face 5 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.1042, 0.0625] - Radius: 0.0208 Face 6 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.1042, 0.4825] - Radius: 0.0208 Face 7 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.1042, 0.6866] - Radius: 0.0208 Face 8 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.3958, 0.0625] - Radius: 0.0521 Face 9 * Loop 1 + Circle 1 - Center: [0.3946, 0.0625] - Radius: 0.0208 Extrusion Extrude the sketch along the normal vector with a depth of 0.1667, resulting in a 3D shape. Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch before extruding. The operation is to create a new solid body. This new shape now represents the first part of the CAD assembly. Additional Details This part has a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.1667 units, and a height of 0.75 units. The final CAD model will be a unique arrangement of the shapes in the subsequent parts.</description>",
