Start by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Sketch: Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw a rectangle with corners at (0.0, 0.0), (0.75, 0.0), (0.75, 0.6857), and (0.0, 0.6857). This sketch has 4 faces, the first one being created by the rectangle. Extrusion: Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.0391 units and opposite normal direction by 0.0 units. Scale the sketch by 0.75. This results in a rectangular prism with dimensions 2 units in length (0.75*2), 1 unit in width (0.75), and 0.5 units in height (0.0391).

This sketch has 4 faces, the first one being created by the rectangle. Extrusion: Extrude the sketch along the opposite normal direction by 0.0214 units. Scale the sketch by 0.6857.

Subtract this prism from the first one to complete the model. The final shape of the model is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face.
