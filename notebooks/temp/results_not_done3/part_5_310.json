Create a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [*-90.0*, *0.0*, *-90.0*] and the translation vector to [*0.0*, *0.0*, *0.0*]. 2. Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Face 1: *Loop 1:* *Line 1:* Start at (0.0, 0.0), end at (0.0339, 0.0). *Line 2:* Start at (0.0339, 0.0), end at (0.0339, 0.0339). *Line 3:* Start at (0.0339, 0.0339), end at (0.0319, 0.0339). *Line 4:* Start at (0.0319, 0.0339), end at (0.0319, 0.002). *Line 5:* Start at (0.0319, 0.002), end at (0.0, 0.002). *Line 6:* Start at (0.0, 0.002), end at (0.0, 0.0). The loop is closed, consisting of 6 lines. 3. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.0339. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 5. Extrude the 2D sketch into 3D model. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.75 units and opposite of normal to 0 units. The sketch scale should be set to 0.0339.
