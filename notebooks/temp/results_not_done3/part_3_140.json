Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. The resulting shape should be a rectangular prism with a tapered top and a flat bottom. The height of the prism should be approximately three times the width of the base. The length of the prism should be 0.75 units, the width should be 0.0052 units, and the height should be 0.75 units. This completes the construction of the first part. **Note**: The subsequent parts will be constructed in a similar manner using the `<part_num>` tags and imperative tone. The detailed sketch and extrusion instructions for the subsequent parts should be provided while ensuring clear and concise language, and avoiding boolean operation terms and unnecessary explanations. The shape, length, width, and height of each part should be explicitly stated to ensure accurate CAD model generation.</description>",

The directions (Clockwise/Counterclockwise) are noted.\\n--Result: Consistent.\\n\\n-Check Extrusion Parameters:\\n--`extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0492), `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0), and `sketch_scale` (0.75) are correctly inferred and match the JSON.\\n--The description states \\\"Operation: Combine the current part with the preceding CAD model by adding material.\\\", which implies an \\\"AddFeatureOperation\\\". However, the JSON specifies `\",\"operation\\\":\\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\"\" ,\". Since this is described as \\\"Part 1\\\", \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" is logical for creating a new independent body. The description's mention of \\\"preceding CAD model\\\" is contradictory if this is indeed the first part. Given the explicit value in the JSON (`NewBodyFeatureOperation`), there's a mismatch with the description's implied operation type (`AddFeatureOperation`).\\n--Result: Inconsistent due to operation type mismatch.\\n\\n-Correction: The description's \\\"Operation: Combine the current part with the preceding CAD model by adding material.\\\" is inconsistent with the JSON's `\\\"operation\\\":\\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\"` for \\\"part_1\\\". If it's truly Part 1, it should be a new body. If it's combining, it should be `AddFeatureOperation` and imply a previous body exists. The current JSON is for a new body. Thus, the description and JSON contradict on the operation type.\\n</think>"
