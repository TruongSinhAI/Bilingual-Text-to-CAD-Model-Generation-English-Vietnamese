This line represents the first curve. 3. **Continue with the second curve:** Draw a line from point (0.199, 0) to (0.199, 0.7194). This line represents the second curve. 4. **Draw the third curve:** Draw a line from point (0.199, 0.7194) to (0, 0.7194). This line represents the third curve. 5. **Complete the loop:** Draw a line from point (0, 0.7194) back to point (0, 0). This line represents the fourth curve and completes the loop. 6. **Scale the sketch:** Apply a uniform scale to the sketch with a factor of 0.7194. This scales the length and width of the sketch. 7. **Twist the sketch (optional):** The Euler angles in the given JSON are all 0°, which means the sketch does not need to be twisted. However, if this was not the case, you would apply a rotation to the sketch using the Euler angles in the JSON. 8. **Translate the sketch:** The translation vector is (0, 0, 0), which means the sketch does not need to be translated. However, if this were not the case, you would translate the sketch using the translation vector in the JSON. 9. **Extrude the sketch:** Extrude the sketch by 0.7347 units in the direction of the normal. The resulting shape should be a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. 10. **Check dimensions:** The resulting prism should have dimensions approximately 2 units in length (0.7194 * 2.7692), 1 unit in width (0.7194), and 0.5 units in height (0.7347). **Part 2:** [Add instructions for Part 2 here] **Part 3:** [Add instructions for Part 3 here] ... **Final Shape:** The final shape should be the resulting object after all parts are constructed and combined. In this case, it is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height.
