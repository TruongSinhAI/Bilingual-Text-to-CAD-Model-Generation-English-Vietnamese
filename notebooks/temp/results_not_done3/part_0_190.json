The points are consistent.-Extrusion:--The extrude depth towards normal (0.15) and opposite normal (0.0) are explicitly stated and match the JSON.--The sketch scale (0.75) is also explicitly stated and matches the JSON.--The operation is correctly inferred as \"\n                ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n                ,\" for creating the primary part.-Correction: The inferred data perfectly aligns with the JSON structure and values. No corrections needed.</think>"
