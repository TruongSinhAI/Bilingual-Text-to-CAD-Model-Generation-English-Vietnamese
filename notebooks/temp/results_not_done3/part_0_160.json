First, create a rectangle by drawing four lines: - Line 1: Start at (0, 0), end at (0.5466, 0). - Line 2: Start at (0.5466, 0), end at (0.5466, 0.75). - Line 3: Start at (0.5466, 0.75), end at (0, 0.75). - Line 4: Start at (0, 0.75), end at (0, 0). **Step 3: Add and constrain circles to the rectangle** 1. Add a circle at the center (0.0525, 0.0711), with a radius of 0.0131 for the first loop. 2. Add a circle at the center (0.105, 0.0711), with a radius of 0.0131 for the second loop. * These circles create a small gap in the metal plate, so they should be concentric with the larger circle drawn in the next step. 3. Add a circle at the center (0.2733, 0.375), with a radius of 0.1257 for the third loop to create the circular hole. 4. Add a circle at the center (0.4942, 0.6789), with a radius of 0.0131 for the fourth loop. * Geometrically, we are drawing a rectangle with a circular hole in the center and two additional smaller holes on either side of the circular hole. **Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch** *Apply the sketch_scale of 0.75 to the entire sketch.* **Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch** 1. Extrude the scaled 2D sketch to a depth of 0.0219 towards the normal. 2. Set the extrude_depth_opposite_normal to 0, since we are not extruding in the opposite direction. **Step 6: Describe the final shape** *The final shape for Part 1 has a width, length, and height of approximately 0.75 meters, 0.75 meters, and 0.0219 meters, respectively. The rectangular plate has a circular hole in the center and two additional smaller holes on either side.*</description>",

    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A CAD model of a rectangular prism with a curved top edge and a flat bottom edge** The first part is a rectangular prism with a curved top edge and a flat bottom edge. The shape is defined by the `description` field and has a length of 0.75 meters, width of 0.0708 meters, and height of 0.75 meters. We will start by creating a new coordinate system using the `coordinate_system` field. The Euler angles are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0708, 0.0]. This will set the origin of the coordinate system to the bottom left corner of the part and orient it correctly. Next, we will create the 2D sketch using the `sketch` field. The sketch consists of a single face (`face_1`) which contains a loop (`loop_1`). The loop consists of 12 lines that form the perimeter of the part. The lines connecting the points [0.0, 0.0], [0.2123, 0.0], [0.2123, 0.184], [0.5377, 0.184], [0.5377, 0.0], [0.75, 0.0], [0.75, 0.0142], [0.5519, 0.0142], [0.5519, 0.1981], [0.1981, 0.1981], [0.1981, 0.0142], and [0.0, 0.0142] form the perimeter of the part. It should be noted that the loop is closed, meaning that the first and last points of the loop are the same. Additionally, each line is connected to the previous line in the loop, forming a continuous perimeter. Next, we will scale the 2D sketch using the `sketch_scale` parameter from the `extrusion` field. The value of 0.75 will scale the entire sketch down by 25%. Then, we will transform the two-dimensional sketch into a three-dimensional solid using the `extrusion` field. The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` parameter of 0.0708 meters will create the height of the rectangular prism. The `sketch_scale` parameter has already been applied, but if it was not, we would apply it to the extrusion depth. Finally, we will use the `operation` field in the `extrusion` field to determine how this part will be combined with any preceding parts. According to the `operation` field, this is a `NewBodyFeatureOperation`, which means that this will create a new solid body.</description>",
