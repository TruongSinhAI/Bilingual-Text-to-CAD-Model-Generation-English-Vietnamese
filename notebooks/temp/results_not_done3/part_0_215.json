The JSON consistently uses `loop_1` for the larger radius circle and `loop_2` for the smaller radius circle. This is a mismatch in loop numbering relative to the JSON structure.\\n    - Crucially, the description for `face_2` is completely erroneous. It states \\\"Draw a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.1046 to create the second face,\\\" and later \\\"Face 2: + Loop 1: This loop is already drawn as a part of Face 1.\\\" This is directly contradicted by the JSON, where `face_2` has `loop_1` consisting of 8 arcs and `loop_2` as a circle with center [0.375, 0.375] and radius 0.1046. The description entirely misses the complex arc geometry of `face_2.loop_1` and incorrectly states `face_2.loop_1` (as described by text) is part of `face_1`.\\n\\n-Extrusion Parameters:\\n    - `extrude_depth_towards_normal`: 0.0467, matches.\\n    - `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`: 0.0, correctly inferred.\\n    - `sketch_scale`: 0.75, matches.\\n    - `operation`: \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\", matches.\\n\\n-Correction: Due to the significant discrepancies and omissions in the description of the sketch structure, particularly for `face_2`, the description does not accurately represent the JSON.
