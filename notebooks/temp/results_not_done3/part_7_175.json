Coordinate System Start by creating a new coordinate system for this part. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.5, 0.0). Base Sketch Create the base sketch on a plane defined by the new coordinate system. The sketch contains eight lines and a rectangular prism-shaped face. 1. **Line 1**: Draw a line from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0). 2. **Line 2**: Draw a line from (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.75). 3. **Line 3**: Draw a line from (0.75, 0.75) to (0.5, 0.75). 4. **Line 4**: Draw a line from (0.5, 0.75) to (0.5, 0.25). 5. **Line 5**: Draw a line from (0.5, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.25). 6. **Line 6**: Draw a line from (0.25, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.75). 7. **Line 7**: Draw a line from (0.25, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75). 8. **Line 8**: Draw a line from (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.0). Extrusion Extrude the sketch along the normal vector by 0.5 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 prior to extrusion.

Part 2 Instructions Create the cutout section of the model The cutout section is another rectangular prism that will be subtracted from the initial one. Coordinate System Use the same coordinate system as part 1 (provided it meets these instructions' needs). Cutout Sketch Create the cutout sketch on the same plane as the base sketch from part 1.

Extrusion Extrude the cutout sketch along the normal vector by 0.25 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 prior to extrusion. The cutout extrusion operation corresponds to \"CutFeatureOperation.\" Dimensions For this part, the length is 0.25 units, the width is 0.25 units, and the height is 0.25 units (after accounting for the 0.25-unit deep extrusion).

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The prism is centered on a white background. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the curved side is perpendicular to both. The model is symmetrical along the center line. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with euler angles (0, 0, -90) and a translation vector (0, 0.75, 0). This will position the part at the correct height and orientation. For the sketch, create a new face and draw six straight lines. These lines will form the perimeter of a rectangle. Starting from the bottom left corner, draw a line to the right with a length of 0.75 units, then draw a line upwards with the same length. Continue drawing lines up and to the left to complete the rectangle. The last line should connect to the starting point, forming a closed loop. Next, scale the sketch by multiplying each coordinate by 0.75. This will reduce the overall size of the rectangle by 25%. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by a distance of 0.75 units. This will create a solid rectangular prism. The final dimensions of this part are: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.75 units * Height: 0.75 units Part 2 The second part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. Begin by reusing the same coordinate system as Part 1. For the sketch, draw the same rectangle as before. This time, however, we will taper the top of the prism. In order to do this, we need to add a horizontal line connecting the midpoints of the two vertical sides of the rectangle. To get the midpoints, find the point halfway along each vertical side, then draw a line between them. Next, scale the sketch by multiplying each coordinate by 0.75. This will reduce the overall size of the rectangle by 25%. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by a distance of 0.375 units. This will create a solid rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. The final dimensions of this part are: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.375 units * Height: 0.75 units Note: Part 2 is built upon Part 1 using the \"JoinFeatureOperation\" operation. This means that Part 2 is added to Part 1, forming a single solid body. Since we are reusing the same coordinate system as Part 1, Part 2 will be positioned and oriented identically to Part 1.</description>",
