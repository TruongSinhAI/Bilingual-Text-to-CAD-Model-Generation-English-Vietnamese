    "prompt": "<description>**Construct the first part: a rectangular prism** Start by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. Use the following parameters: * Euler angles: (0, 0, 0) * Translation vector: (0, 0, 0) Next, create a new 2D sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. This sketch will form the base of the prism. Here are the details of the sketch: * Loop 1: + Line 1: Start Point (0,0), End Point (0.75, 0) + Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0), End Point (0.75, 0.75) + Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.75), End Point (0, 0.75) + Line 4: Start Point (0, 0.75), End Point (0, 0) Now, lets transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. To do so: * Scale the sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75 * Use the euler angles (-90, 0, -90) and the translation vector (0.75, 0, 0.1875) to transform the 2D sketch into 3D The last step is to extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Extrude the sketch by 0.75 towards the normal and 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal. The first part is now complete. The shape of this part is a rectangular prism with the following dimensions: * length: 0.75 * width: 0.75 * height: 0.75 **Construct the second part: a cutout from the first part** Just like before, create a new coordinate system for part 2 with the following parameters: * Euler angles: (-90, 0, -90) * Translation vector: (0.75, 0, 0.1875) Once again, create a new 2D sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. This sketch will form the cutout on the first part. Here are the details of the sketch: * Loop 1: + Line 1: Start Point (0,0), End Point (0.5625, 0) + Line 2: Start Point (0.5625, 0), End Point (0.5625, 0.5625) + Line 3: Start Point (0.5625, 0.5625), End Point (0, 0.5625) + Line 4: Start Point (0, 0.5625), End Point (0, 0) The cutout process is similar to the previous part. First, transform the 2D sketch into 3D sketch with the following parameters: * Scale the sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.5625 * Use the euler angles (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector (0, 0, 0) to transform the 2D sketch into 3D For the extrusion step: * Extrude the sketch by 0.0 towards the normal and 0.75 in the opposite direction of the normal The second part is now complete. The shape of this part is a rectangular prism with a cutout. The cutout has the following dimensions: * length: 0.5625 * width: 0.5625 * height: 0.5625 **Combine both parts: a rectangular prism with a triangular cutout** The final step is to combine the first and second part together. Since both parts intersect each other, we need to use the \"IntersectFeatureOperation\" operation. The final shape is a rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one side. The cutout is centered and has a smaller rectangular shape within it. The model is symmetrical along the cutout's axis. * The length of the rectangular prism is approximately 0.75 * The width of the rectangular prism is approximately 0.75 * The height of the rectangular prism is approximately 0.75 The final CAD model is now complete.

    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional, Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top and Bottom Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. * Face 1 + Loop 1 - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.75] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] The sketch should appear as a closed loop on the X-Y plane. Extrusion With the sketch in place, proceed with extruding it to create a solid body: * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 1.5 * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0 * Sketch Scale: 0.75 * Operation: Create a new solid body Part 2: Intermediate CAD Part (Assuming the creation of Part 2 is based on Part 1) Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system with a specified orientation and location in relation to Part 1, to be determined. Sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane or another appropriate plane based on the new coordinate system. * Sketch a series of lines, arcs, or circles based on the desired shape, orientation, and dimensions. Mention the sequence and number of curves in the loop. For example: + Face 1 - Loop 1 * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.5, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.5, 0.0], End Point [0.5, 0.5] * Arc 1: Start Point [0.5, 0.5], End Point [0.25, 0.75], Mid Point [0.375, 0.625] Extrusion Create a solid body based on the sketch with the appropriate extrusion parameters, including the extrusion depth and scaling factor: * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: [Determined by the design requirements] * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: [Determined by the design requirements] * Sketch Scale: [Determined by the design requirements] * Operation: [Determined by the design requirements. Use natural language descriptions instead of specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation', etc.] Continue for additional intermediate CAD parts Following the creation of each subsequent CAD part, ensure that the appropriate relationship is defined for the operation key. This may entail exchanging material, intersecting material from the current body with that of a previous body, or adding material.
