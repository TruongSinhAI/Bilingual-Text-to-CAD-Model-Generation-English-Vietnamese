This creates the base rectangular prism. Part 2: Creating the Cylindrical Component Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The object has a central hole that runs through its length. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles [90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and translation vector [0.0682, 0.3409, 0.0].

The base is a rectangular prism with dimensions: - Length: 0.6818 - Width: 0.3409 - Height: 0.6818 The top and bottom components are cylinders that have been joined to the base of the prism, resulting in a central hole in the final shape.
