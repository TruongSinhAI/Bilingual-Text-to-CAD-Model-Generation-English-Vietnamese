The height of the prism is approximately three times the width of the base, and the top and bottom faces are parallel to each other. The sides of the prism are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.375, 0.0, 0.0]. This sets the position and orientation of the sketch plane needed to draw the base of the prism. 1. **2D Sketching**: Draw a closed loop on the sketch plane with four connected lines. - Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0143), End Point (0.0204, 0.0) - Line 2: Start Point (0.0204, 0.0), End Point (0.0315, 0.0) - Line 3: Start Point (0.0315, 0.0), End Point (0.0315, 0.0143) - Line 4: Start Point (0.0315, 0.0143), End Point (0.0, 0.0143) 2. **Scaling**: Apply a scale transformation to the sketch including all of its elements using the `sketch_scale` parameter with a value of 0.0315, corresponding to a 0.0315 scaling factor. 3. **3D Sketch Transformation**: Rotate the 2D sketch according to the given Euler angles (x = -90, y = 0, z = -90) and translate its position using the provided translation vector [0.375, 0.0, 0.0]. 4. **Extrusion**: Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal, with an extrusion depth of 0.3817. Then extrude the sketched shape towards the opposite direction of the normal with a depth of 0.0.</description>\", \"S2\\\": \\\"<valid>Yes</valid>\\\", \\\"S3\\\": \\\"<think>***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\\\n\\\\nparts: From the description, we have a single part labeled \\\\\"\n      , \"part_1\\\\\"\n      , \" describing an elongated rectangular prism.
