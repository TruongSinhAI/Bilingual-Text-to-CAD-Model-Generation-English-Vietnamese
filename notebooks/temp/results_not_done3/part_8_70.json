Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) degrees and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.0296, 0.0). This will position and orient the prism on the canvas. **Step 2: Sketching the Prism Face** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw the first line segment with start point at (0.0, 0.0) and end point at (0.0, 0.0691). This will define the left side of the prism. Draw the second line segment with start point at (0.0, 0.0691) and end point at (0.0, 0.1382). This will define the front side of the prism. Draw the third arc segment with start point at (0.0, 0.1382), mid point at (0.0289, 0.2079), and end point at (0.0987, 0.2368). This will define the curved side of the prism. Draw the fourth line segment with start point at (0.0987, 0.2368) and end point at (0.75, 0.2368). This will define the right side of the prism. Draw the fifth line segment with start point at (0.75, 0.2368) and end point at (0.75, 0.1579). This will define the back side of the prism. Draw the sixth line segment with start point at (0.75, 0.1579) and end point at (0.2169, 0.118). This will define the top side of the prism, excluding the curved portion. Draw the seventh arc segment with start point at (0.2169, 0.118), mid point at (0.1473, 0.0891), and end point at (0.1184, 0.0195). This will define the curved portion of the top side of the prism. Draw the eighth line segment with start point at (0.1184, 0.0195) and end point at (0.1184, 0.0). This will complete the top side of the prism. Draw a circle on the same plane with center at (0.0987, 0.1382) and a radius of 0.0493. This will define the cylindrical hole going through the prism. Close the loop to complete the sketch. **Step 3: Extruding the Sketch** Extrude the sketch along its normal vector with a depth of 0.0296 units, creating a solid prism. Use a sketch scale of 0.75 for any scaling operations. The resulting prism should be 0.75 units in length, with a width of 0.0296 units, and a height of 0.75 units. **Step 4: Completing the Body Operation** Join the newly created prism with the existing body to combine the shapes and create the final shape. **Final shape:** The final shape consists of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center and a flat top and bottom. The prism is positioned at an angle and is slightly tilted to the right. The top edge is slightly angled. The prism has a curved side and a flat top and bottom. The prism is centered on the white background. The prism has a curved top edge and a flat bottom edge. The top edge is slightly angled. The prism is 0.75 units in length, 0.0296 units in width, and 0.75 units in height.</description>",

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Instructions Create the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]. This will position and orient the sketch plane correctly for the desired shape. Create the Sketch Plane Now, switch to the sketching environment. The sketch plane is automatically set based on the provided coordinate system. Draw the Base Sketch Start drawing a polygon using the points provided in the `face_1` of the `sketch` section. In order, create lines between the following points: 1. [0.0, 0.0] and [0.75, 0.0] 2. [0.75, 0.0] and [0.75, 0.75] 3. [0.75, 0.75] and [0.375, 0.75] 4. [0.375, 0.75] and [0.375, 0.375] 5. [0.375, 0.375] and [0.0, 0.0] This will form the base shape for the extrusion. Close the Loop Close the loop by connecting the last created line with the first point in the list mentioned above, i.e., [0.0, 0.0]. After creating this loop, the software should automatically recognize it as a closed loop. Extrude the Sketch Now, it's time to extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model. Set the extrusion height based on the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` value as provided in the `extrusion` section, which is 0.375 for this part. Scale the Sketch After extruding the shape, scale the model using the provided scale factor from `sketch_scale`, which is 0.75 for this part. Apply the Operation As per the `operation` value, you'll want to create a new independent 3D body. In other words, join the current solid body with the previous one. After completing these steps, you'll end up with a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly angled top surface, as specified in the description of the part. Dimensions of the intermediate part and final shape: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.375 units - Height: 0.75 units</description>",

Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]. This will position and orient the sketch plane correctly for the desired shape. Create the Sketch Plane Now, switch to the sketching environment. The sketch plane is automatically set based on the provided coordinate system. Draw the Base Sketch Start drawing a polygon using the points provided in the `face_1` of the `sketch` section. In order, create lines between the following points: 1. [0.0, 0.0] and [0.75, 0.0] 2. [0.75, 0.0] and [0.75, 0.75] 3. [0.75, 0.75] and [0.375, 0.75] 4. [0.375, 0.75] and [0.375, 0.375] 5. [0.375, 0.375] and [0.0, 0.0] This will form the base shape for the extrusion. Close the Loop Close the loop by connecting the last created line with the first point in the list mentioned above, i.e., [0.0, 0.0]. After creating this loop, the software should automatically recognize it as a closed loop. Extrude the Sketch Now, it's time to extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model.
