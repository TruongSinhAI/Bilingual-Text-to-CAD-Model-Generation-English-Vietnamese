The sides of the prism are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0894, 0.1042, 0.0] **Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane** Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. **Step 3: Draw the curves for the first face** The first face of the prism is a rectangle. To draw the rectangle, follow these steps: * Draw line 1 from (0.0, 0.1051) to (0.1785, 0.0) * Draw line 2 from (0.1785, 0.0) to (0.3588, 0.102) * Draw line 3 from (0.3588, 0.102) to (0.3605, 0.3092) * Draw line 4 from (0.3605, 0.3092) to (0.182, 0.4143) * Draw line 5 from (0.182, 0.4143) to (0.0018, 0.3122) * Draw line 6 from (0.0018, 0.3122) to (0.0, 0.1051) **Step 4: Close the loop and create the face** Close the loop by connecting the end point of line 6 to the start point of line 1. This will create the first face of the prism, which is a rectangle. **Step 5: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.4143. **Step 6: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] **Step 7: Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to create the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.6473 units and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0 units. The sketch scale is 0.4143. After completing these steps, you will have successfully created the first intermediate CAD part, a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The length of the prism is 0.4143 units, the width is 0.4143 units, and the height is 0.6473 units.</description>",
