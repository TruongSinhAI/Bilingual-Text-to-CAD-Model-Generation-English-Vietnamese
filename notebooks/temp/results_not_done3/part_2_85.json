Step 6: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Step 7: Extrude the 2D sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.4225 units and opposite normal direction by 0 units to create a solid body. This is a new body and will serve as the base for the next part. Step 8: Describe the intermediate part The intermediate part is a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom.
