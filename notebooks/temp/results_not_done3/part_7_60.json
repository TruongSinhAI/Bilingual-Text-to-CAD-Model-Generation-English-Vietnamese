Let's proceed with building this part step by step. **Step 1: Create a New Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 2: Create the 2D Sketch** On the XY plane of the new coordinate system, create a 2D sketch with the following loops and curves: - Loop 1 - Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.0165, 0.0] - Line 2: [0.0165, 0.0] to [0.0165, 0.0331] - Line 3: [0.0165, 0.0331] to [0.0496, 0.0331] - Line 4: [0.0496, 0.0331] to [0.0496, 0.0496] - Line 5: [0.0496, 0.0496] to [0.0, 0.0496] - Line 6: [0.0, 0.0496] to [0.0, 0.0] Please note that this loop is closed, and there are 6 curves in total. **Step 3: Scale the 2D Sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.0496. **Step 4: Transform the 2D Sketch to 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 5: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.75 towards the normal and 0.0 in the opposite direction. This will give you the final shape for part 1. The dimensions of this part are as follows: - Length: 0.0496 - Width: 0.0496 - Height: 0.75 With these instructions, you should be able to generate the parametric CAD model for the first part.
