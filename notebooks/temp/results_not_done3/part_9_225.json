The height, width, and length of this part are 0.75 m, 0.5 m, and 0.75 m, respectively. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.5, 0.0]. This orientation will position the prism properly in the final CAD assembly. Next, create the 2D sketch for part 1. To do so, create a new planar face on the XY plane defined by the new coordinate system. We will create a single face, Face 1, with one loop. For Face 1, create Loop 1. This loop consists of four lines. 1. Line 1 starts at [0.0, 0.0] and ends at [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Line 2 starts at [0.75, 0.0] and ends at [0.75, 0.625]. 3.

Now, we will transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. To do this, scale the sketch by 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. Finally, extrude the scaled 2D sketch into the third dimension. Extrude the height of the prism as 0.5 m toward the normal and 0.0 m in the opposite direction. Apply the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" by directly joining the current sketch to the preceding sketches, if any. Wrap up Part 1: The creation of the three-dimensional rectangular prism is complete. The prism is placed at an elevation of 0.5 m relative to the XY plane, and its length, width, and height are 0.75 m. Now prepare for constructing the subsequent parts, following the same detailed instructions as provided for Part 1.</description>",
