Now, scale the 2D sketch by 0.6674 using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles from the coordinate system and the translation vector from the coordinate system. Next, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. For the extrusion properties: 1. extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal is set to 0.007. 2. extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal is set to 0.0. 3. sketch\\\\_scale remains 0.6674.
