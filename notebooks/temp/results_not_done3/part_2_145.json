    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Creating the Bottom Rectangular Prism Step 1: Creating the Coordinate System Start by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector to (0, 0, 0). Step 2: Creating the Sketch On the XY plane of the newly created coordinate system, create a new sketch. The sketch should contain a single face (face\\\\_1). The following steps describe the creation of the loops and curves for face\\\\_1. Step 3: Creating the Loops and Curves 1. On face\\\\_1, create the first loop (loop\\\\_1) using the following curves: * line\\\\_1: Start Point (0, 0), End Point (0.25, 0) * line\\\\_2: Start Point (0.25, 0), End Point (0.25, 0.25) * line\\\\_3: Start Point (0.25, 0.25), End Point (0.5, 0.25) * line\\\\_4: Start Point (0.5, 0.25), End Point (0.5, 0) * line\\\\_5: Start Point (0.5, 0), End Point (0.75, 0) * line\\\\_6: Start Point (0.75, 0), End Point (0.75, 0.5) * line\\\\_7: Start Point (0.75, 0.5), End Point (0.5, 0.5) * line\\\\_8: Start Point (0.5, 0.5), End Point (0.5, 0.75) * line\\\\_9: Start Point (0.5, 0.75), End Point (0.25, 0.75) * line\\\\_10: Start Point (0.25, 0.75), End Point (0.25, 0.5) * line\\\\_11: Start Point (0.25, 0.5), End Point (0.0, 0.5) * line\\\\_12: Start Point (0.0, 0.5), End Point (0.0, 0) Step 4: Extruding the Sketch Once the sketch is completed, proceed to extrude it in the positive Z direction with a depth of 0.25. This will create the base of the bottom rectangular prism. The height of the bottom rectangular prism, measured from the base to the top, is 0.25. Part 2: Creating the Top Rectangular Prism Step 1: Creating the Coordinate System Reuse the current coordinate system without making any modifications. Step 2: Creating the Sketch Create a new sketch utilized face\\\\_1 of the coordinate system. Step 3: Creating the Loops and Curves The sketch should be identical to the previous one, recreating the loops and curves as described in Part 1, Step 3. Step 4: Extruding the Sketch After creating the sketch, extrude it along the Z-axis, positive direction, by 0.25. This operation will create the top rectangular prism. The height of the top rectangular prism is 0.25, and the combined height of the final 3D model of both rectangular prisms is 0.5 (0.25 for the bottom prism and 0.25 for the top prism). ## Conclusion The provided CAD Assembly JSON describes the desired 3D model consisting of a bottom and top rectangular prism, sharing the same dimensions. By following the provided instructions, the junior CAD designer can create the parametric CAD model accurately. The bottom and top rectangular prisms are created separately using the same sketch but different extrusions. The first extrusion produces the bottom prism, while the second extrusion generates the top prism. The final shape is a combination of both.</description>",
