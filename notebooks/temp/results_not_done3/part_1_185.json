This part is constructed by creating a new coordinate system and a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** For the first part, there is no rotation of the 2D sketch plane, and the translation vector is zero, so the euler\\\\_angles are set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation\\\\_vector is set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch** On the plane defined by the coordinate system, draw a rectangle by creating four lines. The first line starts at [0.0, 0.0] and goes to [0.75, 0.0]. The second line starts at [0.75, 0.0] and goes to [0.75, 0.75]. The third line starts at [0.75, 0.75] and goes to [0.0, 0.75]. The fourth line starts at [0.0, 0.75] and goes to [0.0, 0.0]. **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter. **Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch to 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model, with an extrusion depth of 0.75 units towards the normal, and no extrusion in the opposite direction of normals. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The final dimensions of the part are: - length: 0.75 - width: 0.75 - height: 0.75 This completes the construction of the first part of the CAD assembly. The next part will build on this base part, and subsequent parts will continue to build upon the previously constructed parts using the operation defined for each part.</description>",
