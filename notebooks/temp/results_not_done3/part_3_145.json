This is a discrepancy.)\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-All coordinate system parameters (Euler Angles, Translation Vector) for all three parts match the JSON.\\n-All sketch parameters (circle Center and Radius) for all three parts match the JSON.\\n-All extrusion parameters (extrude_depth_towards_normal, extrude_depth_opposite_normal, sketch_scale) for all three parts match the JSON.\\n-However, for `part_2` and `part_3`, the JSON specifies the `operation` as \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\". The description only states \\\"Extrude the scaled sketch\\\", which does not explicitly indicate a \\\"Join\\\" operation. While \\\"Part 1\\\" correctly implies \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" as the first part, the subsequent parts' operations are not clearly specified in the description to be \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\". This constitutes a mismatch.\\n\\n-Correction: The description should explicitly state \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" or indicate that the extrusion adds to an existing body for Part 2 and Part 3 to fully match the JSON. Without this, the description is incomplete for the `operation` field of Part 2 and Part 3.\\n</think>"

Create a new sketch on Face 1 and draw a rectangle with the following loops and lines: * Loop 1: + Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] + Line 2: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.1525] + Line 3: [0.75, 0.1525] to [0.0, 0.1525] + Line 4: [0.0, 0.1525] to [0.0, 0.0] 3. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 4. Extrude the sketch in the opposite direction of the normal by 0.3535 units. **Part 2:** Create a smaller rectangular prism that will be used to cut into Part 1. 1. Set up the coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.5267, 0.0, 0.0977] 2.

Extrude the sketch in the opposite direction of the normal by 0.3535 units using Part 1 as the target body. **Final shape:** Create a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. 1. Set up the coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 2. Create a new sketch on a plane perpendicular to the positive Z-axis and draw a rectangle with the following dimensions: * Length: 4 units * Width: 2 units 3. Extrude the sketch by 6 units in the positive Z-direction. **Additional instructions:** Ensure that all dimensions and angles are exact to prevent any errors in the final CAD model. Always double-check the coordinate system properties after setting them up, as they may affect the overall orientation and placement of the parts.</description>",
