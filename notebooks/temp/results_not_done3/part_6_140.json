Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.3333. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 6. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.6667 units towards the normal and by 0 units in the opposite direction. Specify the extrusion as a \"JoinFeatureOperation\". Note that the final shape is a rectangular prism with various shapes and sizes cut out of it. The specific shapes and sizes are not specified in the given JSON, so the cutting operation will depend on the final shape requirements.</description>",
