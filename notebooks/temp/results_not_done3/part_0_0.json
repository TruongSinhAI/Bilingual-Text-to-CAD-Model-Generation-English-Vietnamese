Set the operation to create a new solid body. Step 6: Review the Completed Part The completed part is a curved rectangular prism, as specified in the description. The shape is approximately 0.75x0.75 units with a height of 0.375 units. Conclusion By following these instructions, a junior CAD designer can create a 3D CAD model of the given part, following best practices for accuracy, clarity, and conciseness. < note > In order to generate the subsequent parts, the instructions will follow a similar format, beginning with the shape to be constructed, followed by specific instructions to draw the required curves, apply any necessary scaling, and extrude the solid body in 3D space. This clear and consistent method of instruction ensures efficient communication of design intent, enabling accurate CAD modeling and design validation. </ note ></description>",
