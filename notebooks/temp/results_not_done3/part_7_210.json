This part is symmetrical along its central axis. **Step 1: Create the Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.25, 0.0] **Step 2: Draw the Sketch** Now, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. Using the sketching tools, draw eight connected lines to form a closed loop, as shown below: - Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.25] - Line 3: [0.75, 0.25] to [0.5, 0.25] - Line 4: [0.5, 0.25] to [0.5, 0.75] - Line 5: [0.5, 0.75] to [0.25, 0.75] - Line 6: [0.25, 0.75] to [0.25, 0.25] - Line 7: [0.25, 0.25] to [0.0, 0.25] - Line 8: [0.0, 0.25] to [0.0, 0.0] **Step 3: Scale the Sketch** Apply the scaling parameter to the 2D sketch, with sketch_scale set to 0.75. **Step 4: Transform the Sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying a 3D rotation using the euler angles specified earlier, as well as the translation vector. **Step 5: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the 3D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.25 units, creating the initial part body. - Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.25 - Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 - Sketch Scale: 0.75 The operation for this part is 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'. This indicates that this part results in the creation of a new solid body.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: From the description, we have a single part labeled \"\n    ,\"part_1\"\n    ,\".\\n\\npart_1: (Rectangular Prism with Hollow Center)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\"\n    ,\")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.25, 0.0] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.25, 0.0]\"\n    ,\")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0]\"\n    ,\")\\n----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.25] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Line 2: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.25]\"\n    ,\")\\n----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.25], End [0.5, 0.25] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Line 3: [0.75, 0.25] to [0.5, 0.25]\"\n    ,\")\\n----line_4: Start [0.5, 0.25], End [0.5, 0.75] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Line 4: [0.5, 0.25] to [0.5, 0.75]\"\n    ,\")\\n----line_5: Start [0.5, 0.75], End [0.25, 0.75] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Line 5: [0.5, 0.75] to [0.25, 0.75]\"\n    ,\")\\n----line_6: Start [0.25, 0.75], End [0.25, 0.25] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Line 6: [0.25, 0.75] to [0.25, 0.25]\"\n    ,\")\\n----line_7: Start [0.25, 0.25], End [0.0, 0.25] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Line 7: [0.25, 0.25] to [0.0, 0.25]\"\n    ,\")\\n----line_8: Start [0.0, 0.25], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Line 8: [0.0, 0.25] to [0.0, 0.0]\"\n    ,\")\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.25 (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Extrude the 3D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.25 units\"\n    ,\")\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0\"\n    ,\")\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from the description: \"\n    ,\"Sketch Scale: 0.75\"\n    ,\")\\n--operation: \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n    ,\" (Explicitly stated in the description: \"\n    ,\"The operation for this part is 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'\"\n    ,\")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check the lines (line_1 to line_8):\\nline_1 (Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0]) connects correctly with line_2 (Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.25]).\\nline_2 (Start [0.75, 0.25], End [0.5, 0.25]) connects correctly with line_3 (Start [0.75, 0.25], End [0.5, 0.25]).\\nline_3 (Start [0.5, 0.25], End [0.5, 0.75]) connects correctly with line_4 (Start [0.5, 0.25], End [0.5, 0.75]).\\nline_4 (Start [0.5, 0.75], End [0.25, 0.75]) connects correctly with line_5 (Start [0.5, 0.75], End [0.25, 0.75]).\\nline_5 (Start [0.25, 0.75], End [0.25, 0.25]) connects correctly with line_6 (Start [0.25, 0.75], End [0.25, 0.25]).\\nline_6 (Start [0.25, 0.25], End [0.0, 0.25]) connects correctly with line_7 (Start [0.25, 0.25], End [0.0, 0.25]).\\nline_7 (Start [0.0, 0.25], End [0.0, 0.0]) connects correctly with line_8 (Start [0.0, 0.25], End [0.0, 0.0]).\\nline_8 (Start [0.0, 0.0]) connects back to line_1 (Start [0.0, 0.0]).\\n--Result: The sketch loop is valid and closed.\\n\\n-Check the extrusion:\\nExtrusion depth towards normal is 0.25, and opposite normal is 0.0, matching the description.
