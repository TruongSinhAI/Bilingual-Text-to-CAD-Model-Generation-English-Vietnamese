Now, extrude the sketch by 0.15 units towards the normal and 0.0 units in the opposite direction. This will create a 3D solid body. **Part 2: Constructing a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.6].

This will merge the new solid with the previously constructed rectangular prism (Part 1). **Final Shape: A rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center diagonally positioned** Create a new coordinate system based on the existing Part 2, making sure the Euler angles aren't changed while adjusting the Translation Vector in the x-axis to position the cylindrical hole, as well as adjusting the y-axis to set the width slightly larger than the height of Part 1. Please note that for this part, manual adjustments will be necessary and hence no JSON provided. Create a sketch on the Top surface with a center point at 0.0, 0.0 for the cylinder. Draw the cylinder so its height is half the width of Part 2 and that the x coordinate of its end points matches with the x coordinates of Part 1's lines 1 and 4. Subtract the cylinder from Part 2 using the CutFeatureOperation. This results in the final shape - a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center diagonally positioned.</description>",
