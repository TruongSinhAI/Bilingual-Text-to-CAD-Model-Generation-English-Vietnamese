The sloped side has a height of 0.0182 units. *Step 1 - Create a 2D Sketch* 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 2. Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. *Step 2 - Draw the Sketch* 1. Draw the first line segment with a start point of [0.0, 0.0] and an end point of [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Draw the second line segment with a start point of [0.75, 0.0] and an end point of [0.75, 0.3533]. 3. Draw the third line segment with a start point of [0.75, 0.3533] and an end point of [0.0, 0.3533]. 4. Draw the fourth line segment with a start point of [0.0, 0.3533] and an end point of [0.0, 0.0]. All the lines form a closed loop and the loop has 4 line segments. *Step 3 - Transform the Sketch into a 3D Sketch* 1. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch scaling parameter. 2. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. *Step 4 - Extrude the Sketch* 1. Extrude the 3D sketch by a distance of 0.0182 units towards the normal of the sketch. 2. Do not extrude the sketch in the opposite direction of the normal. With these instructions, you should be able to create part 1 of the CAD model, a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The length and width of the part are both 0.75 units, and the height of the sloped side is 0.0182 units.</description>",
