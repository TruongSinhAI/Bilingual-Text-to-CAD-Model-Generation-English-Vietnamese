Furthermore, the circle in `face_2` of the JSON has the exact same properties (center and radius) as `loop_2` in `face_1`. An arc alone would typically not form a closed loop for extrusion unless part of a larger, implicitly closed profile, but the JSON defines a complete circle.\\n\\n- Check `coordinate_system` and `extrusion` properties:\\n  - The coordinate system Euler angles and translation vector match the JSON.\\n  - The extrusion depth, opposite depth, sketch scale, and operation match the JSON.\\n\\n- Overall Correction: The primary mismatch lies in the definition of `face_2` within the sketch.
