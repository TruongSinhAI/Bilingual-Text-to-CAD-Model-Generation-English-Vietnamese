This circle forms loop_1, which in turn forms the complete face_1. **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter.** - Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.0682. **Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch.** - Using the given euler angles and translation vector, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. **Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model.** - Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by a distance of 0.0227, and in the opposite direction by a distance of 0 for the top and bottom faces, effectively creating a flat top and bottom. Upon completion, you'll have a parametric CAD model consisting of the described parts. Remember to double-check the accuracy of each part and their integration to ensure a successful design.</description>",
