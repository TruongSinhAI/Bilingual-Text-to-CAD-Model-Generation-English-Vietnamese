    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: A Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. The Euler angles should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will position the coordinate system at the origin. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch should consist of a single face (face\\_1). **Step 3: Create loops and curves** On face\\_1, create a loop (loop\\_1) consisting of 4 lines (line\\_1, line\\_2, line\\_3, line\\_4). - line\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - line\\_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.45] - line\\_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.45], End Point [0.0, 0.45] - line\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.45], End Point [0.0, 0.0] The loop is closed, and no two lines intersect. The four lines form a rectangle. **Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. This can be done by multiplying each point in the sketch by 0.75. **Step 5: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** There are no rotations or translations required for this 2D sketch, so the euler angles and translation vector can be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a distance of 0.075 units. This will create a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. This corresponds to a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.075 units, as described in the given JSON. The resulting part is the first intermediate part of the final CAD model. **Step 7: Set the operation type** Set the operation type to 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'. This will ensure that the current part is added to the final CAD model during assembly.</description>",

No corrections are required.\\n</think>"
