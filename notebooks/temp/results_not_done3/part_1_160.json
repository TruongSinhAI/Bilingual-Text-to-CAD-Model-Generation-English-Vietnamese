The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal (0.2553 units) and the height is half the length of the sides (0.0061 units). **Step 1: Create a 2D Sketch** Create a new coordinate system using the provided Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector (0.5129, 0.2283, 0.076) in the given JSON data. On this coordinate system, create a 2D sketch. **Step 2: Draw the Lines and Arcs** The sketch contains multiple faces, loops, lines, and arcs.
