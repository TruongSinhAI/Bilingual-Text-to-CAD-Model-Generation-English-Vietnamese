Final shape The final shape of part 1 is 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.25 units. Remaining parts The CAD assembly JSON includes information for multiple parts. Follow a similar process for each part, using the information provided in the JSON to create the appropriate coordinate system, 2D sketch, faces, loops, and extrusions. Remember to scale and transform each sketch using the provided parameters, and to clearly label each part in the final CAD model. For example, if the second part is a cylinder with a specific height, the instructions would start with: Part 2: Cylinder The second part of the CAD assembly is a cylinder. The cylinder has a height of X units and a radius of Y units. Creating the coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin, with no rotation and no translation: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] And so on for each part.
