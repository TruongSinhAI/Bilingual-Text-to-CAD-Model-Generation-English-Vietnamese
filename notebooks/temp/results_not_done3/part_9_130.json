The `NewBodyFeatureOperation` can be used to create the body, with the inner loops defining holes.\\n\\n-Correction: The description for the outer loop of Part 2's sketch is inaccurate. It describes a \\\"rectangular shape\\\" with \\\"four corners\\\", but the JSON implements it with arcs and lines, forming a rounded-end shape, not a pure rectangle. Therefore, the description does not accurately represent the JSON sketch for `loop_1` of Part 2.\\n</think>"

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the given Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) to define the 2D sketch plane for the first part. Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch Create the first face of the sketch as follows: 1. Draw a line from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0). 2. Draw a line from (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.75). 3. Draw a line from (0.75, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75). 4. Draw a line from (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.0). For the second face of the sketch, create a circle at the location (0.1875, 0.375) with a radius of 0.035 to represent the cylindrical hole. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the entire 2D sketch by 0.75 using the sketch scale parameter. Step 4: Transform the sketch Transform the 2D sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector to create a 3D sketch. Step 5: Extrude the 3D sketch Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.375 towards the normal and 0.0 in the opposite direction to create the final shape. This will result in a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center, having a length of 0.75, a width of 0.75, and a height of 0.375. Additional notes The VLM model indicates that the final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The first part contributes to the creation of this shape. The euler angles and translation vector are used to determine the orientation and position of the 2D sketch plane for the first part. The 2D sketch consists of two faces: a rectangle and a circle. The rectangle is constructed using four lines, while the circle is created using a center point and a radius to represent the cylindrical hole. These 2D entities form loops in a clockwise direction as per the constraints mentioned with each loop type. The sketch scale parameter of 0.75 is applied to the entire 2D sketch. The 3D sketch is then generated by transforming the scaled 2D sketch based on the specified euler angles and translation vector. The extrusion creates the final three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The height, width, and length of the final shape are specified as part of the description. The final step involves integrating the current part with the preceding CAD model using the NewBodyFeatureOperation, resulting in the addition of new materials to form the complete shape.</description>",
