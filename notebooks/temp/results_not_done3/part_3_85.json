    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top and Bottom The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. This part is constructed by creating a new coordinate system, a 2D sketch, and then extruding the sketch to a 3D model. Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system for this part with no rotation (euler\\\\_angles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Sketch The sketch is drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. It consists of two faces, each having one loop. Face 1 Face 1 is drawn on the XY plane and has a single loop (loop\\\\_1). This loop is composed of four straight lines (line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, and line\\\\_4). The lines form a rectangle: * line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.54, 0.0] * line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.54, 0.0], End Point = [0.54, 0.54] * line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.54, 0.54], End Point = [0.0, 0.54] * line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.54], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Face 2 Face 2 is constructed in a similar manner to Face 1. Extrusion After creating the sketch, the final step is to extrude the sketch into the third dimension. Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.75 units in the positive Z direction (towards the normal), with no extrusion in the opposite direction (extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal = 0.0). The sketch is scaled by a factor of 0.54 (sketch\\\\_scale = 0.54), resulting in the part having the desired dimensions for the tapered top and bottom. This part represents a NewBodyFeatureOperation. Combining this with any previous parts will result in a new solid body for the CAD assembly.</description>",
