Draw a rectangle using the following lines: * Start Point: [0.0, 0.0] * End Point: [0.75, 0.0] * Start Point: [0.75, 0.0] * End Point: [0.75, 0.5] * Start Point: [0.75, 0.5] * End Point: [0.625, 0.5] * Start Point: [0.625, 0.5] * End Point: [0.625, 0.25] * Start Point: [0.625, 0.25] * End Point: [0.125, 0.25] * Start Point: [0.125, 0.25] * End Point: [0.125, 0.5] * Start Point: [0.125, 0.5] * End Point: [0.0, 0.5] * Start Point: [0.0, 0.5] * End Point: [0.0, 0.0] 3. **Sketch Transformation** Apply a transformation to the 2D sketch using the coordinate system euler angles (-90.0 in Z) and translation vector (0.0, 0.375, 0.0) to position the sketch in 3D space. 4. **Extrusion** Extrude the transformed 2D sketch to create a 3D prism model with these properties: * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.375 * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 * Sketch Scaling Factor: 0.75</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description outlines a single part labeled \"  ,  \"Part 1\"  ,  \".\\n\\npart_1: (Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a hollow center)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from description: \"  ,  \"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\"  ,  \").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"  ,  \"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.0]\"  ,  \").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Derived from description).\\n----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.5] (Derived from description).\\n----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.5], End [0.625, 0.5] (Derived from description).\\n----line_4: Start [0.625, 0.5], End [0.625, 0.25] (Derived from description).\\n----line_5: Start [0.625, 0.25], End [0.125, 0.25] (Derived from description).\\n----line_6: Start [0.125, 0.25], End [0.125, 0.5] (Derived from description).\\n----line_7: Start [0.125, 0.5], End [0.0, 0.5] (Derived from description).\\n----line_8: Start [0.0, 0.5], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description).\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.375 (Derived from description: \"  ,  \"Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.375\"  ,  \").\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Derived from description: \"  ,  \"Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0\"  ,  \").\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from description: \"  ,  \"Sketch Scaling Factor: 0.75\"  ,  \").\\n--operation: \"  ,  \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"  ,  \" (Inferred from \"  ,  \"create a 3D prism model\"  ,  \").\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check Sketch Loop (Line Connections):\\nline_1 (Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0]) connects correctly to line_2 (Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.5]).\\nline_2 (End [0.75, 0.5]) connects correctly to line_3 (Start [0.75, 0.5], End [0.625, 0.5]).\\nline_3 (End [0.625, 0.5]) connects correctly to line_4 (Start [0.625, 0.5], End [0.625, 0.25]).\\nline_4 (End [0.625, 0.25]) connects correctly to line_5 (Start [0.625, 0.25], End [0.125, 0.25]).\\nline_5 (End [0.125, 0.25]) connects correctly to line_6 (Start [0.125, 0.25], End [0.125, 0.5]).\\nline_6 (End [0.125, 0.5]) connects correctly to line_7 (Start [0.125, 0.5], End [0.0, 0.5]).\\nline_7 (End [0.0, 0.5]) connects correctly to line_8 (Start [0.0, 0.5], End [0.0, 0.0]).\\nline_8 (End [0.0, 0.0]) connects back to line_1 (Start [0.0, 0.0]).\\nResult: The sketch forms a closed loop, outlining an outer rectangle and an inner rectangle, which will create a hollow center when extruded.\\n\\n-Check Extrusion Parameters:\\nAll extrusion parameters (depths and scale) are explicitly provided in the description and match the JSON values.
