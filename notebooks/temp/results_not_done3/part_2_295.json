Transform the scaled sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified coordinate system. Extrude the sketch by 0.375 units in the positive Z direction. Add the current part to the previous part. **Instructions for part 3** Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles are -90.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees. The translation vector is 0.375, 0.0, 0.0. Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane. Create the first loop as follows: - Create a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.375, 0.0). - Create a line from point (0.375, 0.0) to point (0.375, 0.375). - Create a line from point (0.375, 0.375) to point (0.0, 0.375). - Create a line from point (0.0, 0.375) to point (0.0, 0.0). Finalize the sketch. The sketch should consist of one face and one loop with four lines. Transform the scaled sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified coordinate system. Extrude the sketch by 0.375 units in the negative Z direction. Create a new solid body with the current part.</description>\"\n    ,\"<valid>No</valid>\"\n    ,\"<think>***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description specifies three parts: \"\n    ,\"Part 1\", \" \"\n    ,\"Part 2\", \" and \"\n    ,\"Part 3\", \".\\n\\nPart 1:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"The euler angles are 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees\", \")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"The translation vector is 0.0, 0.75, 0.0\", \")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1: (A closed loop defining a rectangle)\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.375, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.75] (Derived from description)\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.375, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] (Derived from description)\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.375 (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"Extrude the sketch by 0.375 units in the positive Z direction\", \")\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred, as extrusion is only in the positive Z direction)\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75\", \")\\n--operation: \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", \" (Inferred, as it's the first part and described as \"\n    ,\"Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism\", \")\\n\\nPart 2:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"The euler angles are 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees\", \")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.375] (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"The translation vector is 0.0, 0.375, 0.375\", \")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1: (A closed loop defining a rectangle)\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.375, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.375] (Derived from description)\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.375, 0.375], End Point [0.0, 0.375] (Derived from description)\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.375], End Point [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.375 (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"Extrude the sketch by 0.375 units in the positive Z direction\", \")\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred, as extrusion is only in the positive Z direction)\\n--sketch_scale: 0.375 (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.375\", \")\\n--operation: \"\n    ,\"JoinFeatureOperation\", \" (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"Add the current part to the previous part\", \")\\n\\nPart 3:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"The euler angles are -90.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees\", \")\\n--Translation Vector: [0.375, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"The translation vector is 0.375, 0.0, 0.0\", \")\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1: (A closed loop defining a rectangle)\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.375, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.375] (Derived from description)\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.375, 0.375], End Point [0.0, 0.375] (Derived from description)\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.375], End Point [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description)\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0 (Inferred, as extrusion is only in the negative Z direction)\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.375 (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"Extrude the sketch by 0.375 units in the negative Z direction\", \")\\n--sketch_scale: (Not explicitly stated in the description for Part 3's sketch scaling, but the JSON provides 0.375)\\n--operation: \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", \" (Derived from: \"\n    ,\"Create a new solid body with the current part\", \")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Part 1 Check:\\n--Coordinate system, sketch lines, extrusion depths, sketch scale, and operation are consistent with the description and match the JSON.
