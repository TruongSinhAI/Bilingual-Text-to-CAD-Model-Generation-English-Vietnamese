Face 1 Face 1 will form the outer boundary of the rectangular metal plate. Loop 1 Create Loop 1 with the following linear segments (lines): * Line 1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0) * Line 2: (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.625) * Line 3: (0.75, 0.625) to (0.0, 0.625) * Line 4: (0.0, 0.625) to (0.0, 0.0) Loop 1 forms a closed loop; you can confirm this by checking that the start and end points of each line segment are the same. Loop 2 Create Loop 2 with the following circular arc: * Circle 1: Center (0.2188, 0.1563), Radius: 0.0391 The arc should start at the start point of Line 1 and end at the end point of Line 1, passing through the center of the circle. Loop 3 Create Loop 3 with the following circular arc: * Circle 1: Center (0.2188, 0.4688), Radius: 0.0391 The arc should start at the end point of Line 1 and end at the start point of Line 3, passing through the center of the circle. Loop 4 Create Loop 4 with the following circular arc: * Circle 1: Center (0.5313, 0.1563), Radius: 0.0391 The arc should start at the end point of Line 3 and end at the start point of Line 1, passing through the center of the circle. Loop 5 Create Loop 5 with the following circular arc: * Circle 1: Center (0.5313, 0.4688), Radius: 0.0391 The arc should start at the start point of Line 3 and end at the end point of Line 1, passing through the center of the circle. Coincident Constraints Add coincident constraints where necessary between all the linear and circular segments within each loop to ensure the sketch is fully constrained and defined as a solid/flat rectangle with four holes along its edges. Step 3: Extrude the Sketch to Generate the 3D Model Now, extrude the sketch along the Z-axis (normal to the sketch plane) with the given parameters: * Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0469 * Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 * Sketch scale: 0.75 As there are no existing bodies to interact with, the `operation` will automatically be a NewBodyFeatureOperation. This will create a new solid body with no Boolean interaction with other bodies. The resulting part's dimensions are: * Height: 0.75 * Width: 0.0469 * Length: 0.75</description>",
