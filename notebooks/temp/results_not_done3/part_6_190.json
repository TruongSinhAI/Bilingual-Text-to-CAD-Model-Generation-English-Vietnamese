The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. 1. **Create a new coordinate system.** Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 2. **Generate the 2D sketch.** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system. 3. **Draw the base rectangle for the prism.** Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0].
