The shape is symmetrical and has a rectangular base. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: Coordinate System: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.2417, 0.0] Next, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 2D Sketch: - Face 1: - Loop 1: - Line 1: - Start Point: [0.0, 0.0] - End Point: [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: - Start Point: [0.75, 0.0] - End Point: [0.75, 0.4552] - Line 3: - Start Point: [0.75, 0.4552] - End Point: [0.0, 0.4552] - Line 4: - Start Point: [0.0, 0.4552] - End Point: [0.0, 0.0] Now, scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75.

Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.2417, 0.0] Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to generate the 3D model. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.2417 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal to 0.0. Additionally, apply a sketch scale of 0.75.

The final shape is symmetrical and has a simple, geometric design.
