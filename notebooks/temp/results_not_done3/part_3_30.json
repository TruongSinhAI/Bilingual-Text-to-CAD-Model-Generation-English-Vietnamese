Step 2: Draw 2D sketch 1. Begin a new sketch on the X-Y plane (face_1) of the coordinate system. 2. Create a closed loop (loop_1) consisting of: - line_1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] - line_2: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.4125] - line_3: [0.75, 0.4125] to [0.0, 0.4125] - line_4: [0.0, 0.4125] to [0.0, 0.0] Step 3: Scale sketch Scale the 2D sketch using the sketch_scale factor of 0.75. Step 4: Extrude sketch Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal vector with an extrude_depth_towards_normal value of 0.1875, creating a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The prism has a tapered top due to scaling in step 3. Part 2: Three Vertically Aligned Cylinder Holes Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Maintaining the previous coordinate system, add a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0603, 0.1098, 0.0. Step 2: Draw 2D sketches 1. Begin a new sketch (face_1) on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Draw a circle (circle_1) at the center point [0.091, 0.091] with a radius of 0.091. 2. Begin a new sketch (face_2) on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Draw a circle (circle_1) at the center point [0.316, 0.091] with a radius of 0.091. 3. Begin a new sketch (face_3) on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Draw a circle (circle_1) at the center point [0.541, 0.091] with a radius of 0.091. Step 3: Scale sketches Scale each of the 2D sketches in step 2 using the sketch_scale factor of 0.6321. Step 4: Extrude sketches Since the shapes are cylindrical holes, extrude towards the normal vector with an extrude_depth_towards_normal value of 0.1875 and an extrude_depth_opposite_normal of 0.0, effectively cutting the prism. The result is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a series of four circular cutouts aligned vertically along its length. Continue with the remaining CAD model components as indicated in the JSON until completion. Revisit the boolean operation between current and preceding CAD models by adding these instructions: Step 5: Apply Boolean Operation 5.1. The LAWN MOWER HOUSING CAD model is constructed by combining the rectangular prism, tapered top, and cylinder holes. 5.2. Add the solid bodies by performing a NewBodyFeatureOperation followed by subsequent IntersectFeatureOperations and CutFeatureOperations where necessary. 5.3. After combining all solid bodies, create a final solid body using a NewBodyFeatureOperation representing the complete LAWN MOWER HOUSING. Final Result Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a series of four circular cutouts aligned vertically along its length. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 for the rectangular prism, tapered top, and cylinder holes, following the instructions on sketches, scaling, and extrusion for each component.
