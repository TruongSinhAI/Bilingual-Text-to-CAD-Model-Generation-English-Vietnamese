Additionally, extrude the sketch by a distance of 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal. This results in a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The dimensions of the prism are as follows: Height: 0.14 Width: 0.75 Length: 0.75 **Part 2: Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom** Create a new coordinate system with the following Euler angles and translation vector: Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Translation Vector: [0.0809, 0.0219, 0.14] For the second sketch, draw a circle on the XY plane. The circle should have the following properties: Center: (0.2872, 0.2872) Radius: 0.2872 Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.5744. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the same Euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the 3D sketch by a distance of 0.0588 in the opposite direction of the normal. The resulting solid is a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. The dimensions of the cylindrical object are: Height: 0.0588 Width: 0.5744 Length: 0.5744 **Final Shape: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a curved top edge** The final shape is obtained by joining the parts together using the appropriate boolean operation. Start by creating a new coordinate system with the Euler angles and translation vector of part 1. Perform a join boolean operation between the two parts to combine them into a single solid. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a curved top edge. The dimensions of the final shape are: Height: 0.2999 Width: 0.5744 Length: 0.75</description>",
