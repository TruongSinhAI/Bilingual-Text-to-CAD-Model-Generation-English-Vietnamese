Sketching the Rectangular Prism 1. Draw the first face: * Create a new line with a start point of [0.0, 0.0] and an end point of [0.1071, 0.0]. * Create a new line with a start point of [0.1071, 0.0] and an end point of [0.1071, 0.75]. * Create a new line with a start point of [0.1071, 0.75] and an end point of [0.0, 0.75]. * Create a new line with a start point of [0.0, 0.75] and an end point of [0.0, 0.0]. * This face (face\\\\_1) is a closed rectangle, consisting of 4 lines and 1 loop. Extruding the Rectangular Prism 1. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 2. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by a distance of 0.0536 units. 3. This results in a new 3D solid body: a rectangular prism. * The length of this prism is approximately 0.75 units, the width is approximately 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0536 units. Creating the Cylindrical Hole 1. Create a new sketch on the same XY plane as the rectangular prism. 2. Draw a circle with a center point at [0.0536, 0.375] and a radius of 0.0536. * This results in a circle as a single 2D curve, with endpoints at coordinates: ```bash - [0.0536, 0.4286] - [0.0536, 0.3214] ``` 3. This circle has a single loop, closed by default, and forms a face. Extruding the Cylindrical Hole Through the Prism 1. Extrude the newly created sketch through the prism, making the hole extend from face\\\\_1 all the way through the prism. 2. The height of this hole is equal to the height of the prism (0.0536 units), thus piercing the whole prism. * The extrusion distance for this will be the height of the part\\\\_1 in the final assembly, i.e. 0.0536 units. Now that you have finished instructions for part\\\\_1, you can move on to create further parts or any subsequent tasks required to form the final assembly. The first part results in a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center, slightly taller than it is wide, positioned at a 45 degree angle from the viewer, just as described in the prompt.</description>",
