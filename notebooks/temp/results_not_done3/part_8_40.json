However, visually tracing the lines as given: L1->L2->L3->L4->L5->L6->L7->L8 and L8 connects back to L1's start point (0.0,0.0). Let's re-verify the given sequence from description with the JSON.\\n- line_1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0)\\n- line_2: (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.75)\\n- line_3: (0.75, 0.75) to (0.5, 0.75)\\n- line_4: (0.5, 0.75) to (0.5, 0.25)\\n- line_5: (0.5, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.25)\\n- line_6: (0.25, 0.25) to (0.25, 0.75)\\n- line_7: (0.25, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75)\\n- line_8: (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.0)\\n\\nConnectivity check:\\nL1_end(0.75, 0.0) == L2_start(0.75, 0.0) -> OK\\nL2_end(0.75, 0.75) == L3_start(0.75, 0.75) -> OK\\nL3_end(0.5, 0.75) == L4_start(0.5, 0.75) -> OK\\nL4_end(0.5, 0.25) == L5_start(0.5, 0.25) -> OK\\nL5_end(0.25, 0.25) == L6_start(0.25, 0.25) -> OK\\nL6_end(0.25, 0.75) == L7_start(0.25, 0.75) -> OK\\nL7_end(0.0, 0.75) == L8_start(0.0, 0.75) -> OK\\nL8_end(0.0, 0.0) == L1_start(0.0, 0.0) -> OK\\n--Result: The sketch lines form a perfectly closed loop as described, creating a rectangular outline with a rectangular cut-out.\\n\\n-Correction: The inferred data is fully consistent with the provided description and does not require any modifications.\\n</think>"
