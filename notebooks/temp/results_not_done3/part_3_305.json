    "prompt": "<description>**<part\\\\_1> - 3D Model of a Ring with a Hollow Center** Construct a 3D model of a ring with a hollow center. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0, 0, 0 and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0125, 0.0625]. This will position the ring vertically with its center at a height of 0.0625. Now let's draw the 2D sketch for the ring: 1. Create the first face, `face_1`, which will represent the outer diameter of the ring. 2. Within `face_1`, draw the first loop, `loop_1`. This loop will create the outer circle of the ring. Set the center of the circle at (0.3625, 0.3625) and provide a radius of 0.3625. 3. Draw another loop, `loop_2`, within `face_1`. This loop will construct the inner circle of the ring. Use the same center as `loop_1` but with a radius of 0.3525. Next, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch: 1. Scale the 2D sketch using the provided sketch scale of 0.725. 2. Apply a 3D rotation transformation to the 2D sketch using the euler angles from the coordinate system. 3. Apply a translation vector transformation to the 2D sketch using the translation vector provided in the coordinate system. Lastly, generate the 3D model by extruding the 2D sketch: 1. Determine the normal direction for the extrusion operation. 2. Set the extrusion depth toward the normal to 0.0312. 3. Set the extrusion depth opposite the normal to 0.0312. The resulting part will have the following specifications: * Height: 0.0625 * Width: 0.725 * Length: 0.725 **<part\\\\_2> - Cylindrical Object with a Tapered End** Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered end that's standing upright. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0, 0, -90 and the translation vector to [0.35, 0.375, 0.05]. This will position the cylindrical object with a tapered end on the right, touching the ring (part\\\\_1) and below it slightly. Now let's draw the 2D sketch for this cylindrical object: 1. Create the first face, `face_1`, which will represent the circular base of the cylindrical object. 2. Within `face_1`, draw the first loop, `loop_1`. This loop will create the base circle. Set the center of the circle at (0.0125, 0.0125) and provide a radius of 0.0125. Next, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch: 1. Scale the 2D sketch using the provided sketch scale of 0.025. 2. Apply a 3D rotation transformation to the 2D sketch using the euler angles from the coordinate system. 3. Apply a translation vector transformation to the 2D sketch using the translation vector provided in the coordinate system. Lastly, generate the 3D model by extruding the 2D sketch along the z-axis: 1. Set the extrusion depth toward the positive Z axis to 0.1875 and towards the negative Z axis to 0.1875. The resulting part will have the following specifications: * Height: 0.025 * Width: 0.375 * Length: 0.025</description>",
