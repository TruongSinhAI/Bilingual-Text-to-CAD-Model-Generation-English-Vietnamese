Each linear segment is a continuous and connected curve that forms the loop. Note that this loop is closed, as it forms a continuous path on the sketch plane. After creating the sketch with these lines, apply a scaling transformation with the scaling factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch. Then, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the previously defined coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z direction of the coordinate system by a distance of 0.0441 units.

Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 - Translation Vector: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 Next, create a sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. This sketch contains a single face (face_1) with a loop (loop_1) that consists of five linear segments: 1. line_1: Draw a line segment from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.6838, 0.0). 2. line_2: Draw a line segment from the point (0.6838, 0.0) to the point (0.7213, 0.0066). 3. line_3: Draw a line segment from the point (0.7213, 0.0066) to the point (0.75, 0.0353). 4. line_4: Draw a line segment from the point (0.75, 0.0353) to the point (0.0146, 0.0353). 5. line_5: Draw a line segment from the point (0.0146, 0.0353) to the point (0.0, 0.0). Each linear segment is a continuous and connected curve that forms the loop. Note that this loop is closed, as it forms a continuous path on the sketch plane. After creating the sketch with these lines, apply a scaling transformation with the scaling factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch. Then, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the previously defined coordinate system.
