Please provide the necessary details to create Part 2. Final Shape The given JSON does not include a Part 2 entry. Therefore, I can only provide the instructions for Part 1. If you provide Part 2 information, I can then assemble Part 1 and Part 2 into the final shape specified: \"A long, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end.\" Assemble Part 1 and Part 2 according to the boolean operation required for the final shape. You should interpret the boolean operations as follows: * \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" (Part 1): A \"New Body\" operation that creates a new solid body. * \"CutFeatureOperation\" (Part 2 or connecting operation): A subtractive operation that cuts or removes materials. * \"IntersectFeatureOperation\" (Part 2 or connecting operation): A non-subtractive operation that intersects with an existing body to keep the intersecting volume. * \"JoinFeatureOperation\" (Part 2 or connecting operation): An additive operation that joint or adds material to the Target body.</description>",
