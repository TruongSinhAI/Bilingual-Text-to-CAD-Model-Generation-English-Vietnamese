Now, transform the 2D sketch into 3D space using Euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate_system section. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D part. Extrusion depth towards the normal direction: 0.0209, no extrusion in the opposite direction. The final part dimensions are: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.0209 - Height: 0.767 (0.0209 + 0.0124 + 0.7337) Now, you can create a new solid body from the extruded 2D sketch.
