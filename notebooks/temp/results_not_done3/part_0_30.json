For arc 8, start at the end point of arc 7, and end at (0.267, 0.6312). Following arc 8, create arc 9, starting at the end point of arc 8, and ending at (0.0323, 0.282). Next, create arc 10, starting at the end point of arc 9, and ending at (0.2241, 0.282). Finally, create arc 11, starting at the end point of arc 10, and ending at the start point of arc 1. This completes the first loop of face 1. For the second loop of face 1, create a circle with center at (0.1583, 0.1532) and radius of 0.1199. The third loop of face 1 consists of a circle with center at (0.3953, 0.2669) and radius of 0.1194. Create the fourth loop of face 1 by drawing a circle with center at (0.3953, 0.5224) and radius of 0.1194. The fifth loop of face 1 consists of a circle with center at (0.6105, 0.1417) and radius of 0.1199. 3. **Extrude face 1** Extrude face 1 by 0.0643 units in the positive direction of the normal, resulting in a height of 0.0643. Apply a scaling factor of 0.7498 to the sketch before extrusion.</description>",
