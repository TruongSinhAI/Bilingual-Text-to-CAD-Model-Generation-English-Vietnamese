The rectangular loop consists of seven lines: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.2479, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.2479, 0.0], End Point [0.2479, 0.4959] * Line 3: Start Point [0.2479, 0.4959], End Point [0.595, 0.4959] * Line 4: Start Point [0.595, 0.4959], End Point [0.595, 0.7438] * Line 5: Start Point [0.595, 0.7438], End Point [0.2479, 0.7438] * Line 6: Start Point [0.2479, 0.7438], End Point [0.0, 0.7438] * Line 7: Start Point [0.0, 0.7438], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Note that Line 7 connects to Line 1, creating a closed loop for the first face of the prism. Create the second face of the prism The second face is identical to the first face, creating a closed shape. Follow the same process as with the first face, reusing the same dimensions and lines. Extrude the shape The extrusion depth for both faces is set using the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` parameters: * `extrude_depth_towards_normal`: 0.0088 units * `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`: 0.0 units After extrusion, a closed rectangular prism with a pointed end will be formed.</description>",
