The euler angles should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Now, let's create the 2D sketch for this part. The 2D sketch will be drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch will consist of a single face (face\\\\_1). Face\\\\_1 will consist of a single loop (loop\\\\_1). Loop\\\\_1 will consist of 4 lines. - Line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] - Line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.75] - Line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.75, 0.75], End Point = [0.0, 0.75] - Line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.75], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] The loop is always closed, so the start point of Line\\\\_1 and the end point of Line\\\\_4 are the same point. Now, let's scale the 2D sketch using the sketch\\\\_scale scaling parameter. The sketch\\\\_scale should be set to 0.75. Next, let's transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. To do this, we will use the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, let's extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal should be set to 0.1875 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal should be set to 0. The sketch scale should be set to 0.75. The boolean operation for this part should be \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", which means we are creating a new solid body. The final shape of this part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a curved edge on one side. The prism is white and has a flat top and bottom. The curved edge is on the right side of the prism. The prism is centered in the image. The length of the prism is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.1875 units.</description>",
