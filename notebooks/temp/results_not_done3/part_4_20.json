    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles for this system should be [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector should be [0.0, 0.45, 0.0]. This will position the coordinate system so that the positive x-axis points to the right, the positive y-axis points down, and the positive z-axis points out of the page. Next, create the 2D sketch for the prism. On face 1 of the coordinate system, draw a rectangle with four lines. The first line should go from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0), the second from (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.525), the third from (0.75, 0.525) to (0.0, 0.525), and the fourth from (0.0, 0.525) to (0.0, 0.0). This will create a rectangle with a width of 0.75 and a height of 0.525. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75, then transform it into a 3D sketch. Rotate the sketch using the euler angles from the coordinate system and translate it using the translation vector. This will position the sketch so that it is coplanar with the positive x-y plane of the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Set the extrude depth towards the normal as 0.45 and the extrude depth opposite the normal as 0.0. This will create a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Part 2: Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. As with Part 1, create a new coordinate system. For this part, the euler angles should be [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector should be [0.1875, 0.0, 0.375]. Create a 2D sketch for the prism. On face 1 of the coordinate system, draw a rectangle with four lines. The first line should go from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.375, 0.0), the second from (0.375, 0.0) to (0.375, 0.15), the third from (0.375, 0.15) to (0.0, 0.15), and the fourth from (0.0, 0.15) to (0.0, 0.0). This will create a rectangle with a width of 0.375 and a height of 0.15. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.375, then transform it into a 3D sketch. Rotate the sketch using the euler angles from the coordinate system and translate it using the translation vector. This will position the sketch so that it is coplanar with the positive x-y plane of the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Set the extrude depth towards the normal as 0.0 and the extrude depth opposite the normal as 0.1125. This will create a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Note that the height is approximately twice the width and the length of the shorter side is about half the length of the longer side. Final shape: Construct a rectangular prism with a single rectangular hole through its center, aligned with the longer side of the prism, centered on a white background. As with the previous parts, create a new coordinate system. For the final shape, the euler angles should be [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector should be [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Create a 2D sketch for the prism. On face 1 of the coordinate system, draw a rectangle with four lines. The first line should go from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0), the second from (0.75, 0</description>",
