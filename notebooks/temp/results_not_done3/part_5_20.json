The prism is slightly tilted to the right. **Height:** 0.03 units **Width:** 0.75 units **Length:** 0.75 units 1. **Create Coordinate System:** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation (Euler Angles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and no translation (Translation Vector = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]). 2. **Draw Sketch on Face 1:** Draw a 2D sketch on Face 1 of the newly created coordinate system. 3. **Create Loop 1 on Sketch:** Create a loop (Loop 1) consisting of 4 line segments (Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4) as follows: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.6] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.6], End Point [0.0, 0.6] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.6], End Point [0.0, 0.0] 4. **Scale Sketch:** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 (sketch_scale = 0.75). 5. **Transform Sketch to 3D:** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the extrusion depths provided. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.03 units and along the opposite direction by 0 units (extrude_depth_towards_normal = 0.03, extrude_depth_opposite_normal = 0.0). 6. **Create New Body:** This operation results in the creation of a new solid body (operation = \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"). **Additional Information:** - The 3D sketch contains 1 face and 1 loop. - The loop consists of 4 line segments. - The length and width of the prism are both 0.75 units, while the height is 0.03 units. - The final shape is tilted slightly to the right (along the X-axis) due to the orientation of the coordinate system.</description>",

    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A Symmetrical, Circular Object with a Central Hole** The first part of the CAD model is a symmetrical, circular object with a central hole. It is the base part for the final shape. In order to construct this part, we will follow the four steps to generate an intermediate CAD part. **Step 1: Draw a 2D Sketch** Create a new coordinate system for the sketch in the origin (0, 0, 0). Begin by drawing a 2D sketch on the XY plane. The sketch consists of one main face, which can be divided into six loops (loop\\\\_1 to loop\\\\_6). **Step 2: Scale the Sketch** Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 to adjust its size. This scaling factor is specified in the 'sketch\\\\_scale' parameter in the JSON data. **Step 3: Transform the Scaled Sketch into 3D Sketch** Transform the 2D scaled sketch into a 3D sketch by using the euler angles and translation vector specified in the JSON data: 1. Set the euler\\\\_angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] to ensure a proper orientation in 3D space. 2. Define the translation\\\\_vector as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] to keep the sketch in its original position. **Step 4: Extrude the Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 3D sketch along the Z-axis based on the depth of 'extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal' in the JSON data. In this particular instance, the extrusion depth is 0.0225. **Sketch Description:** * The sketch contains one main face. This face is segmented into six unique regions: loop\\\\_1 to loop\\\\_6. * Loop\\\\_1: A curved section with arc\\\\_1, line\\\\_1, and line\\\\_2. * Loop\\\\_2: A circular hole defined by circle\\\\_1. * Loop\\\\_3: A circular hole defined by circle\\\\_1. * Loop\\\\_4: A circular hole defined by circle\\\\_1. * Loop\\\\_5: A small circular section defined by circle\\\\_1. * Loop\\\\_6: A circular hole defined by circle\\\\_1. The base part's dimensions are: * Height: 0.0225 * Width: 0.75 * Length: 0.75 Continue with this process for the additional parts from the CAD Assembly JSON as necessary, providing clear and concise instructions for each part while detailing curves, loops, and faces.</description>",

Line 2: Start point (0.0625, 0), end point (0.0625, 0.0417). c. Line 3: Start point (0.0625, 0.0417), end point (0, 0.0417). d. Line 4: Start point (0, 0.0417), end point (0, 0). 3. In the sketch, create two loops: a. Loop 1: Includes lines 1 and 4. b. Loop 2: Includes lines 2, 3, and a tangentially connected arc to complete a closed loop. 4. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.0625. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified Euler angles (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector (0, 0, 0). 6. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.75 units towards the normal.
