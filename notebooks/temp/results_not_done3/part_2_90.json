all parts are directly and correctly matched from the description.\\n--Sketch details (lines for parts 1 & 2, circles for parts 3 & 4) match the description's specified points and radii, and the line loops are correctly closed.\\n\\n-Discrepancy:\\n--The `sketch_scale` value within the `extrusion` object is provided in the JSON for all four parts (0.6094 for Part 1, 0.6094 for Part 2, 0.3891 for Part 3, and 0.3422 for Part 4), but this parameter is *not mentioned anywhere in the corresponding description* for the extrusion of any of these parts.\\n--The operations `NewBodyFeatureOperation` for Parts 1 and 2, and `CutFeatureOperation` for Parts 3 and 4 are reasonable inferences based on the common CAD operations for \"\n    , \"constructing\"  ,\"  \"\n    , \"prisms\"  ,\"  \"\n    ,
