    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Shape and Dimensions Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The length of the sides is twice the height of the prism. The height of the prism is one-third of the length of the sides. The prism is centered on the white background. The dimensions of the part are 0.1875 units in length, 0.75 units in width, and 0.1875 units in height. Creating the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (0, 0, -90) and the translation vector to (0, 0.75, 0). This will ensure that the front face of the prism will be slightly angled. Creating the Sketch Create a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch should have one face with a single loop. The loop should have 4 lines: 1. The first line starts at (0, 0) and ends at (0.0938, 0). 2. The second line starts at (0.0938, 0) and ends at (0.0938, 0.1875). 3.

The dimensions of the part are approximately 0.0094 units in length, 0.675 units in width, and 0.675 units in height. Creating the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to (-90, 0, -90) and the translation vector to (0.0938, 0.0375, 0.0375). This will ensure that the object is centered and aligned vertically. Creating the Sketch Create a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch should have four faces, each with a single loop. Each loop should have one circle with the same radius and different center points. - The first circle has a radius of 0.0094 units and its center point is at (0.0094, 0.0094). - The second circle has a radius of 0.0094 units and its center point is at (0.0094, 0.1031). - The third circle has a radius of 0.0094 units and its center point is at (0.6656, 0.0094). - The fourth circle has a radius of 0.0094 units and its center point is at (0.6656, 0.1031).
