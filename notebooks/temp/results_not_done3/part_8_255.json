Step 5: Extrude the sketch Extrude the sketch depth towards the normal: 0.1875, and the depth away from the normal: 0.1875, respectively. This completes the construction of the first part, which contributes to the final shape being a tall, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The part measures 0.075 in length, 0.375 in width, and 0.075 in height. This single part consists of eight lines and eight arcs spread across two loops that form a square-like pattern, providing a solid structure for the final shape. The loops are shaped consistently, creating a leveled and even surface with no interruptions, and consequently, the overall consistent and planned proportions of the final piece.</description>",
