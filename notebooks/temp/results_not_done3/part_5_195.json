Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: - Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) - Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.0267, 0.0) Now, create the 2D sketch for this part. It will be drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. For the first face of the sketch: Create a loop with 8 curves as follows: 1. A line from (0.0, 0.25) to (0.0267, 0.25) 2. A line from (0.0267, 0.25) to (0.0267, 0.0) 3. A line from (0.0267, 0.0) to (0.1933, 0.0) 4. An arc from (0.1933, 0.0) to (0.2767, 0.0833) with midpoint at (0.2523, 0.0244) 5. A line from (0.2767, 0.0833) to (0.2767, 0.6667) 6. An arc from (0.2767, 0.6667) to (0.1933, 0.75) with midpoint at (0.2523, 0.7256) 7. A line from (0.1933, 0.75) to (0.0267, 0.75) 8. A line from (0.0267, 0.75) to (0.0267, 0.5833) The total length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.0267 units, and the height is 0.75 units. Next, scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.0267 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. The sketch scale should be set to 0.75. Since this is the first part, there's no preceding CAD model to perform a boolean operation with. Therefore, create a new solid body for this part.</description>",
