Part 1: Base Rectangular Prism Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. For the sketch, create a new face and a loop with four lines: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.375, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.75] * Line 3: Start Point [0.375, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Extrude the sketch by 0.075 units towards the normal and 0 units opposite the normal, and scale the sketch by 0.75. Part 2: Tapered Top Rectangular Prism Construct two rectangular prisms aligned parallel to each other, with a slight angle between them. The dimensions of each prism are 0.6 units by 0.6 units by 0.075 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.075, 0.075. For the sketch on face 1, create a loop with four lines: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.075, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.075, 0.0], End Point [0.075, 0.6] * Line 3: Start Point [0.075, 0.6], End Point [0.0, 0.6] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.6], End Point [0.0, 0.0] For the sketch on face 2, create a loop with four lines: * Line 1: Start Point [0.3, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.375, 0.0], End Point [0.375, 0.6] * Line 3: Start Point [0.375, 0.6], End Point [0.3, 0.6] * Line 4: Start Point [0.3, 0.6], End Point [0.3, 0.0] Extrude the sketches by 0.075 units towards the normal and 0 units opposite the normal, and scale the sketches by 0.6.
