The translation vector should be set to (0, 0, 0.075). Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the newly created coordinate system. Step 3: Sketch the rectangular prism On the X-Y plane, use a line to connect points (0, 0) and (0.6, 0). Then, use an arc to connect points (0.6, 0) and (0.6, 0.3), with a midpoint at (0.75, 0.15). Next, draw a line from point (0.6, 0.3) to point (0, 0.3), and finally, connect point (0, 0.3) back to point (0, 0). The loop consists of 4 curves. Step 4: Sketch the cylindrical hole In the same sketch, draw a second loop consisting of 4 curves: 1. A line from point (0.2226, 0.1313) to point (0.24, 0.1313). 2. A line from point (0.24, 0.1313) to point (0.24, 0.1688). 3. A line from point (0.24, 0.1688) to point (0.2226, 0.1688). 4. An arc from point (0.2226, 0.1688) back to point (0.2226, 0.1313), with a midpoint at (0.075, 0.15). Step 5: Scale and extrude the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75, then extrude the sketch in the direction opposite of the Z-axis by 0.075 units. This will create a solid body, resulting in the final shape: A rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. Dimensions The length, width, and height of the rectangular prism component are 0.75 units, 0.75 units, and 0.075 units, respectively. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of 0.075 units. Note: The sketch scale is not explicitly provided; it is inferred from the given description as a necessary step for generating the final shape.</description>",
