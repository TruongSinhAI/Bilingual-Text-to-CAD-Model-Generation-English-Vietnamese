Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a circle with its center at [0.375, 0.375] and a radius of 0.375. *Extrusion* 1. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.75x. 2. Extrude the scaled circle along the Z-axis by 0.0987 units towards the positive direction. This part has the following dimensions: - Height: 0.0987 - Width: 0.75 - Length: 0.75 *** (Note: The `sketch_scale` parameter of `0.75` indicates that the 2D sketch used in this part is scaled by a factor of 0.75, relative to the original design intent. This implies that the `length` and `width` dimensions will be smaller than the original intent by a factor of 0.75.) (Note: The `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` parameter of `0.0` indicates that this part has no extrusion in the negative Z-direction.) (Note: The `NewBodyFeatureOperation` operation in this part simply creates a new solid body, without making any Boolean operations with the existing parts.) (Note: In general, the `sketch_scale` parameter applies to the sketch geometry, and the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` parameters apply to the geometry of the extrusion operation. The `operation` parameter specifies how the current part is added to the previous parts.) (Note that the shapes, curves, loops, and faces are not explicitly mentioned in the instructions above because the CAD software will automatically generate these based on the 2D sketch and the extrusion parameters provided.) (Note that the `euler_angles` in the coordinate system rotate the sketch plane by 90 degrees around the X-axis, followed by another 90 degrees around the Z-axis, and the `translation_vector` moves the sketch plane along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes, respectively. These transformations are applied to the 2D sketch plane before the sketch is drawn on it.) (Note that the loops and faces are determined by the CAD software based on the arrangement of the curves and the constraints specified for each loop.) (Note that the `center_point` in the circle is specified relative to the coordinate system, and the `radius` parameter is a scalar value, defining the size of the circle.) (Note that the curves in the loop can be drawn either manually or by using various sketching tools available in the CAD software.) (Note that loops can be closed by using various constraints available in the CAD software.) (Note that the `cut`, `join`, `intersect`, and `new body` operations in the `operation` parameter correspond to the `CutFeatureOperation`, `JoinFeatureOperation`, `IntersectFeatureOperation`, and `NewBodyFeatureOperation` Boolean operations, respectively.) (Note that the `height`, `length`, and `width` parameters in the `description` section depend on the orientation and positioning of the coordinate system and the sketched geometry in the 3D space.) (Note that the instructions above assume that the CAD software has a reasonable default behavior for creating and manipulating sketches and solids based on the specified geometric and dimensional parameters.)</description>",
