    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Long, Thin, Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** The first part is a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. It is created by first defining a new coordinate system, and then creating a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch will contain one face, and the face will contain one loop. The loop will be closed and will have multiple lines. Start by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. This will position the coordinate system for the 2D sketch correctly in relation to the final shape. Next, create a 2D sketch on the plane defined by the new coordinate system. The sketch should have one face, and the face should contain one loop. This loop will have 12 lines, which form the perimeter of the rectangular prism. The lines should be connected to form a closed loop, indicated by the fact that the start and end points of the last line should be the same as the start and end points of the first line. The specific coordinates for the start and end points of each line can be obtained from the \"Start Point\" and \"End Point\" properties in the \"line_1\" through \"line_12\" entries of the \"face_1\" section in the JSON data. Once the sketch is complete, scale it using a scaling parameter of 0.0278. This scaling will ensure that the 2D sketch matches the correct size for the final shape. Next, transform the scaled sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified Euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. This will position the 3D sketch correctly in relation to the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use an extrusion depth of 0.75 towards the normal, and 0.0 in the opposite direction. This will create the prism shape with the desired dimensions. The extrusion scaling parameter should be set to 0.0278. Overall, this part has dimensions of approximately 0.0278 units in length, 0.75 units in width, and 0.0278 units in height.</description>",

In typical CAD JSON structures, multiple faces within the same `sketch` object are usually assumed to be on the same sketch plane (e.g., the XY plane, if not otherwise specified for the sketch itself). If `face_2` were on the XZ plane, it would likely be defined as part of a separate sketch object or have an explicit plane definition within its own context.

This means that if both faces are extruded under this single instruction, they would *both* be extruded by 0.1042 units in the *opposite* direction of the normal. This contradicts the description's instruction for `face_2` to be extruded \\\"towards the normal\\\".\\n---The `sketch_scale` and `operation` values match the description.\\n\\n-Correction: The JSON for Part 2 does not accurately represent the described sketch planes for face_1 and face_2, nor does it allow for the differing extrusion directions specified for each face within a single extrusion block. The description implies separate or more granular extrusion control than what is provided for `part_2` in the JSON.\\n</think>"
