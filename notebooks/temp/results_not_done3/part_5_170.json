This completes the rectangular shape for face 1. Next, create face 2. Within face 2, create loop 1. Within this loop, create line 1 from (0.1025, 0.0) to (0.1025, 0.1631), line 2 from (0.1025, 0.1631) to (0.1025, 0.1779), line 3 from (0.1025, 0.1779) to (0.4361, 0.1779), line 4 from (0.4361, 0.1779) to (0.4361, 0.0), and line 5 from (0.4361, 0.0) to (0.1025, 0.0). This completes the rectangular shape for face 2. The main rectangular prism consists of 2 faces, 2 loops, and 10 lines. The height of this prism is 0.75 units, the width is 0.0019 units, and the length is also 0.75 units. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.0019 units towards the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction of the normal. Apply a sketch scale of 0.75. **Part 2: Creating the Smaller Rectangular Prism** Create a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.0019, 0.4165). Create the 2D sketch. On face 1, create loop 1. Within this loop, create line 1 from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.3335, 0.0), line 2 from (0.3335, 0.0) to (0.3335, 0.3335), line 3 from (0.3335, 0.3335) to (0.0, 0.3335), and line 4 from (0.0, 0.3335) to (0.0, 0.0). This completes the rectangular shape for face 1. The smaller rectangular prism consists of 1 face, 1 loop, and 4 lines. The height of this prism is 0.3335 units, the width is 0.0019 units, and the length is 0.3335 units. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system.

    "reasoning": "<description>**Part 1: Creating the Main Rectangular Prism** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.0019, 0.0). Now, create the 2D sketch. On face 1, create loop 1. Within this loop, create line 1 from (0.0, 0.4165) to (0.3335, 0.4165), line 2 from (0.3335, 0.4165) to (0.3335, 0.75), line 3 from (0.3335, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.75), and line 4 from (0.0, 0.75) to (0.0, 0.4165). This completes the rectangular shape for face 1. Next, create face 2. Within face 2, create loop 1. Within this loop, create line 1 from (0.1025, 0.0) to (0.1025, 0.1631), line 2 from (0.1025, 0.1631) to (0.1025, 0.1779), line 3 from (0.1025, 0.1779) to (0.4361, 0.1779), line 4 from (0.4361, 0.1779) to (0.4361, 0.0), and line 5 from (0.4361, 0.0) to (0.1025, 0.0). This completes the rectangular shape for face 2. The main rectangular prism consists of 2 faces, 2 loops, and 10 lines. The height of this prism is 0.75 units, the width is 0.0019 units, and the length is also 0.75 units. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.0019 units towards the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction of the normal. Apply a sketch scale of 0.75. **Part 2: Creating the Smaller Rectangular Prism** Create a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.0019, 0.4165). Create the 2D sketch. On face 1, create loop 1. Within this loop, create line 1 from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.3335, 0.0), line 2 from (0.3335, 0.0) to (0.3335, 0.3335), line 3 from (0.3335, 0.3335) to (0.0, 0.3335), and line 4 from (0.0, 0.3335) to (0.0, 0.0). This completes the rectangular shape for face 1. The smaller rectangular prism consists of 1 face, 1 loop, and 4 lines. The height of this prism is 0.3335 units, the width is 0.0019 units, and the length is 0.3335 units. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system.
