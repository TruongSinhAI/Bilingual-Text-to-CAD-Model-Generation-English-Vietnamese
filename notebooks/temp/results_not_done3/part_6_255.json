Add loops (loop_1) to each sketch consisting of 4 lines, each identical to those in Part 1, but rotated 90 degrees around the Z-axis. 4. Scale the 2D sketches by a factor of 0.75. 5. Transform each scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 6. Extrude each 2D sketch into a 3D model with the following properties: * Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0 * Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.6136 (Same as the height of Part 1) * Sketch scale: 0.75 * Boolean operation: Join (JoinFeatureOperation) with the previous model.\\n</description>\\n<valid>No</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description refers to \\\"Part 1\\\" and \\\"Part 2\\\".\\n\\npart_1: (Base Rectangular Prism)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Directly from description).\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.6136] (Directly from description).\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1: (4 lines)\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0]\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.75]\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75]\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0]\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0477\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75\\n--operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (From \\\"Boolean operation: Add (NewBodyFeatureOperation)\\\").\\n\\npart_2: (Curved Side - Rectangular Prism)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Identical to Part 1).\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.6136] (Identical to Part 1).\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1: (loop_1 with 4 lines, rotated from Part 1's loop)\\n----line_1, line_2, line_3, line_4: Expected to be derived from Part 1's loop, rotated.\\n--face_2: (loop_1 with 4 lines, rotated from Part 1's loop)\\n----line_1, line_2, line_3, line_4: Expected to be derived from Part 1's loop, rotated.\\n--face_3: (loop_1 with 4 lines, rotated from Part 1's loop)\\n----line_1, line_2, line_3, line_4: Expected to be derived from Part 1's loop, rotated.\\n--face_4: (loop_1 with 4 lines, rotated from Part 1's loop)\\n----line_1, line_2, line_3, line_4: Expected to be derived from Part 1's loop, rotated.\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.6136\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75\\n--operation: \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" (From \\\"Boolean operation: Join (JoinFeatureOperation)\\\").\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n- Check Part 1:\\n-- Coordinate system: Matches JSON.\\n-- Sketch: `face_1`, `loop_1`'s lines form a closed square from [0,0] to [0.75,0.75].

Add loops (loop_1) to each sketch consisting of 4 lines, each identical to those in Part 1, but rotated 90 degrees around the Z-axis.\\\"\\n--- Part 1's sketch is a 0.75x0.75 square. Rotating it 90 degrees would produce the same size square, potentially shifted if rotated about a non-origin point.\\n--- The JSON for Part 2's `sketch` shows four distinct small squares (face_1 to face_4), e.g., face_1's loop goes from [0,0] to [0.0682,0.0682]. These are significantly smaller and positioned differently (at corners) than a rotated version of Part 1's main sketch. This is a clear and major *mismatch* between the description and the JSON sketch geometry for Part 2. The description implies applying the same large sketch rotated, while the JSON creates four small, distinct square sketches.\\n-- Extrusion: All parameters match JSON.\\n- Correction: The description for Part 2's sketch is fundamentally incorrect when compared to the JSON. The JSON creates four small squares at the corners, not rotated versions of the large Part 1 sketch. This needs to be corrected in the description.\\n</think>"
