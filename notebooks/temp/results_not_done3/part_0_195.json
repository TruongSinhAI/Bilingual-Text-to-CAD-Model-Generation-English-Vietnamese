The operation \"\n            , \"JoinFeatureOperation\"\n            , \" for Part 2 suggests it is being added to an existing body or used in a way to combine with Part 1. While the description \"\n            , \"Cylindrical Object with a Flat Top and Bottom and a Central Hole\"\n            , \" might imply a cutting operation to create a hole, the JSON specifically uses \"\n            , \"JoinFeatureOperation\"\n            , \" for the *creation* of Part 2. This means Part 2 is itself a cylinder that is then joined or is intended to be used in a subsequent boolean operation (which is not described in this JSON fragment for part 2 to create a hole). The description simply states \"\n            , \"Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model\"\n            , \" for Part 2, which allows for `JoinFeatureOperation`.
