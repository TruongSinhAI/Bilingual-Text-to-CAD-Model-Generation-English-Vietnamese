However, the description specifies \"  \n      ,\"Extrude the 2D sketch\"  \n      ,\" but does not explicitly state the \"  \n      ,\"operation\"  \n      ,\" type \"  \n      ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"  \n      ,\" as present in the JSON. While extrusion \"  \n      ,\"opposite the normal\"  \n      ,\" often implies a cut in CAD, the description does not explicitly state this operation. This is a missing detail.\\\\n\\\\n-Check Part 3:\\\\n  - Coordinate System: Matches the description. The Z-translation 0.3 also matches the extrusion depth of Part 1, implying this feature starts on the same plane as the top of Part 1.\\\\n  - Sketch Circle: Center and Radius match.\\\\n  - Extrusion: Depths and scale match. Similar to Part 2, the description specifies \"  \n      ,\"Extrude the 2D sketch\"  \n      ,\" but does not explicitly state the \"  \n      ,\"operation\"  \n      ,\" type \"  \n      ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"  \n      ,\" as present in the JSON. This is a missing detail.\\\\n\\\\n-Correction: The descriptions for Part 2 and Part 3 are incomplete as they do not explicitly state the \"  \n      ,\"operation\"  \n      ,\" type (i.e., \"  \n      ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"  \n      ,\") for their respective extrusions, even though the extrusion parameters suggest it.\\\\n</think>"
