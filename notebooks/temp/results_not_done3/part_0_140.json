This will create loop 1 on face 1 of the sketch. **Step 4: Extrude Sketch** Extrude the sketch by 0.75 units in the direction of the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction of normal. Set the sketch scale to 0.012. **Additional Instructions:** The resulting CAD part will be a long, thin, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end. The length of the part is 0.012 units, the width is 0.012 units and the height is 0.75 units. Note: The shape is not a perfect cylinder as it is tapered and the dimensions are provided at the time of creation of this shape. **Final Instructions** Create the CAD part by following the above instructions. **Additional Instructions:** 1. During the creation of curves, ensure that the lines are connected end-to-end in order to form a closed loop. 2. When creating arcs and circles, make sure that the end point of the arc or circle is connected to the start point of the same arc, circle or line. 3. Extrusion depth should be determined based on the desired height of the part. 4. Always check the orientation of the extrusion direction to ensure that the part is being created as intended. 5. Use the sketch scale factor to adjust the size of the sketch if necessary. **Additional Assumptions:** 1. The coordinate system, sketch, extrusion, and description keys are assumed to be in the correct order for each part. 2. The euler angles and translation vector for the coordinate system are assumed to be in the correct format and values. 3. The dimensions for width, length, and height are assumed to be accurate. 4. The shape of the part is assumed to be as described in the \"shape\" field of the description key.</description>",
