The origin of this coordinate system will be located at (0.0, 0.75, 0.0). Sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system created above. The sketch consists of a single face (face_1) and one loop (loop_1). Loop and Curves Loop_1 consists of eight linear segments (line_1 to line_8) as follows: 1. line_1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.0105, 0.0) 2. line_2: (0.0105, 0.0) to (0.0105, 0.1836) 3. line_3: (0.0105, 0.1836) to (0.2937, 0.1836) 4. line_4: (0.2937, 0.1836) to (0.2937, 0.0105) 5. line_5: (0.2937, 0.0105) to (0.3042, 0.0105) 6. line_6: (0.3042, 0.0105) to (0.3042, 0.1941) 7. line_7: (0.3042, 0.1941) to (0.0, 0.1941) 8. line_8: (0.0, 0.1941) to (0.0, 0.0) These lines form a closed loop defining the boundary of face_1. Extrusion Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.3042 (given by sketch_scale). Then, extrude the scaled sketch along the z-axis (normal to the sketch plane) by a distance of 0.75 units.
