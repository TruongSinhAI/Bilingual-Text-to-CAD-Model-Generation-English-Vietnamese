Begin by creating a new coordinate system that is rotated -90 degrees along the z-axis and translated along the y-axis by 0.0253 units. **Sketching the Profile of the Rectangular Prism:** 1. On the x-y plane, draw the first line segment from (0, 0.3094) to (0, 0.4406). 2. Draw the next line segment from (0, 0.4406) to (0.0234, 0.4406). 3. Continue with the next line segment from (0.0234, 0.4406) to (0.0234, 0.75). 4. Draw the next line segment from (0.0234, 0.75) to (0.3984, 0.75). 5. Proceed with drawing the line segment from (0.3984, 0.75) to (0.3984, 0.4406). 6. Next, draw the line segment from (0.3984, 0.4406) to (0.4219, 0.4406). 7. Continue with the line segment from (0.4219, 0.4406) to (0.4219, 0.3094). 8. Draw the next line segment from (0.4219, 0.3094) to (0.3984, 0.3094). 9. Proceed with the line segment from (0.3984, 0.3094) to (0.3984, 0). 10. Draw the line segment from (0.3984, 0) to (0.0234, 0). 11. Lastly, draw the line segment from (0.0234, 0) to (0.0234, 0.3094). **Creating the Circular Hole:** 1. Begin the first arc segment from the point (0.1406, 0.2344), with the midpoint at (0.2109, 0.1641), and ending at (0.2813, 0.2344). 2. Draw the line segment from (0.2813, 0.2344) to (0.2813, 0.5156). 3. Continue with the arc segment from (0.2813, 0.5156) to (0.2109, 0.4453), and ending at (0.1406, 0.5156). 4. Finish with the line segment from (0.1406, 0.5156) to (0.1406, 0.2344), thus closing the circular hole. **Extruding the Sketch to a Solid Model:** 1. Extrude the 2D sketch along the positive z-axis by 0.0253 units using the specified scaling parameter of 0.75. 2. The boolean operation to combine the extruded part with the preceding CAD model(s) should be \"adding material\" (JoinFeatureOperation). The resulting part will have the following dimensions: - Height: 0.75 units - Width: 0.0253 units - Length: 0.75 units</description>",
