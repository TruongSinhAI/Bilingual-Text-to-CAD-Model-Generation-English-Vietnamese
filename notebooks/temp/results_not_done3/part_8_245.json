    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with Cylindrical Hole** *Shape*: A rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. The prism is positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the top right corner of the image. The cylindrical hole is centered along the diagonal axis of the prism. The prism has a flat bottom and a flat top. *Dimensions*: The height of the prism is approximately twice the width (0.75m), and the width is approximately half the height (0.0843m). The diameter of the cylindrical hole is also 0.0843m. *Instructions*: 1. Construct a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 2. Create the first face for the sketch: * Draw a rectangle, and label each corner as follows: + Corner 1: [0.0, 0.0] + Corner 2: [0.0152, 0.0] + Corner 3: [0.0152, 0.0843] + Corner 4: [0.0, 0.0843] 3. Define a single loop, comprising four lines, connecting the corners in the sequence: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1. 4. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.0843. 5. Apply a 3D rotation to the scaled 2D sketch, using the Euler angle values from the coordinate system: * Angle 1: 0.0 * Angle 2: 0.0 * Angle 3: 0.0 6. Apply a translation to the rotated 2D sketch, based on the translation vector from the coordinate system: * Vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 7. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal, with a depth of 0.75m. 8. Create a cylindrical hole by performing a cut operation on the extruded prism: * Position the cylindrical hole centered along the diagonal axis, with a diameter of 0.0843m and a height equal to the width of the prism (0.0843m). This completes the instruction for generating the rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole.</description>",

However, the provided JSON only defines the steps to create the rectangular prism (`part_1`) and does not include any sketch for a cylinder or a `CutFeatureOperation` to create the hole.
