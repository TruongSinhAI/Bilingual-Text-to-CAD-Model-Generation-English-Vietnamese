The JSON's structure for part_4's sketch does not align with the description's instruction to create a \\\"first face\\\" for the large circle and a \\\"second face\\\" for the smaller circle, especially the duplication of the smaller circle and the concentric nature implied by `loop_1` and `loop_2` under a single `face_1`.\\n\\n-Correction: The sketch structure for Part 4 in the JSON does not align with the description.
