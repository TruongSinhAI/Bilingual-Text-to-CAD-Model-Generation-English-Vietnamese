Loop 2: Center [0.3339, 0.1393], Radius 0.0321 (this forms the first small hole) 2. Loop 3: Center [0.3339, 0.3964], Radius 0.0321 (this forms the second small hole) 3. Loop 4: Center [0.4624, 0.2679], Radius 0.1071 (this forms the central hole) Create two more loops, each containing a circle: 1.

Loop 6: Center [0.591, 0.3964], Radius 0.0321 (the fourth small hole) Extrusion Extrude the sketch by 0.0964 units towards the normal. The final dimensions of the part are: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.0964 Note: The final shape is a flat rectangular metal plate, with a central circular hole and four smaller holes around it. The plate has a smooth surface.</description>",
