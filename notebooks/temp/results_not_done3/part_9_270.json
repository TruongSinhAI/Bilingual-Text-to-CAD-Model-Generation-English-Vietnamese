    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A Rectangular Prism with a Curved Side** The first part of the assembly is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The curved side has a radius of 0.5 units. **Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the euler angles set to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and the translation vector set to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. This will be the coordinate system for the entire part. **Sketching** We will create three faces for this part. **Face 1** On face 1, create a circle with center at (0.1837, 0.1837) and radius 0.1837. This will be loop 1 on face 1. **Face 2** On face 2, create a line from (0.2283, 0.0055) to (0.7036, 0.1243). Follow this by creating an arc with start point at (0.7036, 0.1243) and end point at (0.7036, 0.2431). The mid point of this arc is at (0.6275, 0.1837). Next, create a line from (0.7036, 0.2431) to (0.2283, 0.362). Finally, create an arc with start point at (0.2283, 0.362) and end point at (0.2283, 0.0055). The mid point of this arc is at (0.3675, 0.1837). This completes loop 1 on face 2. **Face 3** On face 3, create a circle with center at (0.6888, 0.1837) and radius 0.0612. This will be loop 1 on face 3. **Extrusion** Extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.0612 towards the normal and 0 towards the opposite normal. Use a sketch scale of 0.75. The operation for this extrusion is \"New Body Feature Operation\". **Dimensions** The length of this part is approximately 0.75 units, the width is also approximately 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0612 units. These dimensions are based on the sketch scale and the extrusion depth. Proceed to create subsequent parts following the same pattern, describing each part's curves, loops, faces, and operations clearly and concisely. Remember to provide the dimensions for each part as well.</description>",
