This part is consistent.-Part 2: All coordinate system parameters, sketch details (face_1 and face_2, their loops, and the circles with their centers and radii), and extrusion parameters (extrude_depth_towards_normal, extrude_depth_opposite_normal, sketch_scale, and operation) match the JSON data exactly. The description correctly separates the two circles into different faces (face_1 and face_2), aligning with the JSON structure. This part is consistent.-Correction: The inferred data is accurate and does not require further modifications. The description is fully consistent with the JSON.</think>"
