However, the JSON's `sketch` section matches the given line coordinates perfectly.\\n- Extrusion:\\n-- \"\n    ,\"extrude_depth_towards_normal\"\n    ,\" (0.0129), \"\n    ,\"extrude_depth_opposite_normal\"\n    ,\" (0.0), and \"\n    ,\"sketch_scale\"\n    ,\" (0.7286) match the JSON values.\\n-- The \"\n    ,\"operation\"\n    ,\" is inferred as \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n    ,\" which is consistent with creating a new shape and matches the JSON.\\n\\n- Correction: All numerical and structural parameters derived from the detailed instructions in the description (coordinates, extrusion depths, scale, coordinate system properties) align perfectly with the JSON. The high-level semantic description of the shape at the beginning is a qualitative detail that does not affect the correctness of the generated geometric parameters. No corrections are needed based on the CAD instructions.\\n</think>"
