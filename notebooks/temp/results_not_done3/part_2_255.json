The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 3 units by 4 units by 5 units. 1. **Create Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees for the x, y, and z axes, respectively. Define the translation vector as [0.0, 0.2394, 0.0]. This configuration will ensure the proper orientation of the 2D sketch in 3D space for the extrusion process. 2. **Generate 2D Sketch** Create a new 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. 3. **Define and Constrain Lines and Loops** * Face 1 * Loop 1 * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.3989] * Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.3989], End Point [0.0, 0.3989] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.3989], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Ensure the loop is closed by connecting Line 1 to Line 4, and set any other required constraints for the loop. 4. **Extrude Sketch (Generate 3D Model)** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction using a depth of 0.2394 units and an opposite-direction depth of 0 units (i.e., no extrusion opposite the normal). Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 before extrusion. This step will produce a three-dimensional rectangular prism based on the defined 2D sketch. The first part consists of a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides.
