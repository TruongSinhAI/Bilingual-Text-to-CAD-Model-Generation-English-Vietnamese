No changes to JSON are required, but the description's claim about \"\n      ,\"rectangle\"\n      ,\" should be corrected or the points should be adjusted to form a true rectangle.

Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch for the part Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (face 1 of the coordinate system). The sketch contains a single face (face 1). The face consists of 4 lines. First line (line 1): Start at [0.0, 0.0] and end at [0.0968, 0.0]. Second line (line 2): Start at [0.0968, 0.0] and end at [0.0968, 0.0968].

Each line is connected end-to-end to form a closed loop, making the sketch a single face. This represents the base of the rectangular prism. Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.0968. This will ensure the sketch's dimensions match the desired length and width. Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch With the scaled 2D sketch in hand, generate a 3D sketch using the original coordinate system. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction with an extrusion depth of 0.75. This will create the rectangular prism. The rectangular prism has a height of 0.75, width of approximately 0.0968, and length of 0.0968. The sides are parallel to each other, and the top and bottom faces are flat. The subsequent parts will be described in a similar fashion, with their respective shapes and dimensions. It is important to state the shape, describe the detailed instructions to build the part with clarity, and provide all information in the context of the final name and shape of the parts. Furthermore, avoid specific boolean operation terms, and use their natural language descriptions instead. This way, a junior CAD designer can generate accurate CAD models.</description>",
