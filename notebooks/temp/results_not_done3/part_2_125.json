This forms the last hole. **Extrusion:** Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.0417 units. There is no extrusion in the opposite direction. Scale the sketch by 0.75 before extruding.

Each arc connects correctly to a line, and each line connects correctly to an arc, forming a closed loop.\\n    - For instance, arc_1 ends at [0.0694, 0.0], which is the start point of line_1. This pattern continues around the perimeter, ensuring a valid closed loop.\\n    - The midpoints for the arcs are consistent with creating rounded corners.\\n  - loop_2, loop_3, loop_4, loop_5 (Holes):\\n    - Each circle for the holes is correctly defined with its center and radius, matching the JSON. The coordinates ensure they are spaced as described.\\n  - All geometric parameters and their values in the sketch match the description precisely.\\n\\n- Extrusion:\\n  - Extrusion depths (towards and opposite normal) and the sketch scale factor match the description. The operation type \"\n            ,\"New Body Feature Operation\"\n            ,\" is explicitly stated and appropriate for creating a new part.\\n\\n- Overall Consistency: The detailed geometric instructions and parameters provided in the description are entirely consistent with the JSON structure and values. The higher-level description \"\n            ,\"Rectangular Prism with a slightly angled front face\"\n            ,\" can be interpreted from the rounded corners created by the arcs in the sketch.\\n\\n- Correction: No corrections are necessary; the inferred data is accurate and complete.\\n</think>"
