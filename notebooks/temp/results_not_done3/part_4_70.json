    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Curved Side Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler Angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the Translation Vector to (0.0, 0.45, 0.0). Sketch Create the first face of the sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 1. **Line 1**: Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.0). 2. **Line 2**: Draw a line from point (0.75, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.525). 3. **Line 3**: Draw a line from point (0.75, 0.525) to point (0.0, 0.525). 4. **Line 4**: Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.525) to point (0.0, 0.0). This completes the loop and the sketch for this part of the 3D model. The sketch contains 4 lines and one face. Extrusion Extrude the sketch using the extrusion property values: 1. Extrusion depth towards normal: 0.45 2. Extrusion depth opposite normal: 0 3. Sketch scale: 0.75 This concludes the instructions for Part 1. The final shape will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. The top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the side faces. The part has a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.45 units, and a height of 0.75 units. Conclusion These instructions will help the junior CAD designer generate the parametric CAD model based on the given CAD Assembly JSON. The instructions cover the initial coordinate system, the sketch description (including lines, arcs and circles, if present), and the final extrusion property values (along with the sketch scale) for a correct 3D model. **Note**: These instructions are provided in the context of the *final shape* without any additional assumptions. Therefore, the designer should follow them strictly to obtain the desired output, without making any alterations or deviations. The instructions include the mention of *height*, *width*, and *length*, when applicable.</description>",
