This part require scaling, so let's define that now. *- Scale the entire sketch created so far by a factor of 0.75.* *- Transform the 2D sketch into 3D through the coordinate system defined earlier, using the provided Euler angles and translation vector.* Now, we'll define the extrusion properties. In this case, extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.03 while moving along its normal vector. *- Extrude the 3D model to the specified depth of 0.03, normal to the sketch plane.* To segregate this part from preceding CAD models, we'll use a join boolean operation. *- Join or add material to preceding CAD models with this part.*</description>\\n<valid>No</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: From the description, we have \\\"Part 1\\\", which will be represented as \\\"part_1\\\".\\n\\npart_1: (A Tapered Rectangular Prism with a Single Hole)\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from \\\"Euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]\\\").\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.05, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"translation vector of [0.0, 0.05, 0.0]\\\").\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1: (Inferred as the default face for a single sketch).\\n    - loop_1:\\n      - line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"connecting the following points: [0.0, 0.0], [0.75, 0.0]\\\").\\n      - line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.2] (Derived from \\\"connecting the following points: [0.75, 0.0], [0.75, 0.2]\\\").\\n      - line_3: Start [0.75, 0.2], End [0.0, 0.2] (Derived from \\\"connecting the following points: [0.75, 0.2], [0.0, 0.2]\\\").\\n      - line_4: Start [0.0, 0.2], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"connecting the following points: [0.0, 0.2], [0.0, 0.0]\\\", completing the loop).\\n    - loop_2:\\n      - circle_1: Center [0.7, 0.1], Radius 0.025 (Derived from \\\"Center=[0.7, 0.1], Radius=0.025\\\").
