Perform a join operation with the previous body.</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: From the description, there are two parts: \\\"part_1\\\" and \\\"part_2\\\".\\n\\npart_1: (Rectangular prism)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description).\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description).\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] (from description).\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.4539] (from description).\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.4539], End Point [0.0, 0.4539] (from description).\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.4539], End Point [0.0, 0.0] (from description).\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0987 (from \\\"Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.0987 units\\\").\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (inferred as not specified).\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (from \\\"Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75\\\").\\n--operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (inferred from \\\"Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model\\\").\\n\\npart_2: (3D model of a rectangular prism)\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description).\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0379, 0.0325, 0.0987] (from description).\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.457, 0.0] (from description).\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.457, 0.0], End Point [0.457, 0.3985] (from description).\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.457, 0.3985], End Point [0.0, 0.3985] (from description).\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.3985], End Point [0.0, 0.0] (from description).\\n--face_2:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start Point [0.4934, 0.0], End Point [0.6927, 0.0] (from description).\\n----line_2: Start Point [0.6927, 0.0], End Point [0.6927, 0.3985] (from description).\\n----line_3: Start Point [0.6927, 0.3985], End Point [0.4934, 0.3985] (from description).\\n----line_4: Start Point [0.4934, 0.3985], End Point [0.4934, 0.0] (from description).\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0316 (from \\\"Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.0316 units\\\").\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (inferred as not specified).\\n--sketch_scale: 0.6927 (from \\\"Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.6927\\\").\\n--operation: \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" (from \\\"Perform a join operation with the previous body\\\").\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check the sketch for part_1:\\nline_1 to line_4 form a closed rectangle.
