Remember to follow the rules for sketch constraints and loop composition. Describe the height, width, and length of each intermediate part and the final shape in the context of the final shape that you have determined. Provide only the instructions without any additional assumptions. *Note: No specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation' etc should be used. Instead, use their natural language descriptions. Provide clear headings and section breaks to organize each part's instructions. Use ordinal numbers to denote the parts, sketches, curves, loops, or faces.* The specific details of all the curves, loops, and faces for each part are provided in the given \"CAD Assembly JSON.\" A junior CAD designer can use this information to generate an accurate CAD model. For Part 1, the 2D sketch is a rectangle (consisting of 4 vertices, 4 lines, and 1 face) and is extruded with a depth of 0.0062 meters to create a 3D shape. The coordinate system has the origin at (0, 0, 0) with no rotations or translations, and has dimensions of 0.75 meters in both length and width, and 0.0063 meters in height.</description>",
