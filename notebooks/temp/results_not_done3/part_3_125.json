Sketch 1: Face 1 Start by creating a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch contains two faces (face\\\\_1 and face\\\\_2), each with one loop. We will first describe the curves and loops in face\\\\_1. Face 1 contains a single loop (loop\\\\_1) with five curves. * The first curve (arc\\\\_1) is an arc with a start point at [0.0, 0.125], a mid point at [0.1264, 0.0327], and an end point at [0.2795, 0.0]. * The second curve (line\\\\_1) is a line with a start point at [0.2795, 0.0] and an end point at [0.2795, 0.25]. * The third curve (arc\\\\_2) is an arc with a start point at [0.2795, 0.25], a mid point at [0.1911, 0.2866], and an end point at [0.1545, 0.375]. * The fourth curve (line\\\\_2) is a line with a start point at [0.1545, 0.375] and an end point at [0.0, 0.375]. * The fifth curve (line\\\\_3) is a line with a start point at [0.0, 0.375] and an end point at [0.0, 0.125]. Sketch 1: Face 2 Now, let's describe the curves and loops in face\\\\_2 of the same sketch. Face 2 contains a single loop (loop\\\\_1) with five curves. * The first curve (line\\\\_1) is a line with a start point at [0.0, 0.375] and an end point at [0.1545, 0.375]. * The second curve (line\\\\_2) is a line with a start point at [0.0, 0.625] and an end point at [0.0, 0.375]. * The third curve (arc\\\\_1) is an arc with a start point at [0.2795, 0.0], a mid point at [0.6218, 0.5281], and an end point at [0.0, 0.625]. * The fourth curve (line\\\\_3) is a line with a start point at [0.2795, 0.0] and an end point at [0.2795, 0.25]. * The fifth curve (arc\\\\_2) is an arc with a start point at [0.2795, 0.25], a mid point at [0.3679, 0.4634], and an end point at [0.1545, 0.375].
