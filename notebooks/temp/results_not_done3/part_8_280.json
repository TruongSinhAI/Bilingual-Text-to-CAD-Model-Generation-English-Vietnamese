Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the defined euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector (0.0, 0.0429, 0.0214). Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0214 units (towards the positive Z direction) to create the final 3D part. The part's dimensions are as follows: * Shape: A long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.0214 (determined from the extrude depth) This completes the instructions for constructing Part 1 of the CAD model. Continue this process for any additional parts, following the given JSON data and instructions.

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom, and a rectangular hole in the center of its side. The first part of the CAD model is a rectangular prism with a curved top surface and a flat bottom surface. There is also a rectangular hole in the center of one of the sides. The following steps will detail how to construct this part. Creating the coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin `(0, 0, 0)` with no rotation. This will be the base coordinate system for the first part. Creating the base sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (plane defined by the coordinate system). Draw the following curves, loops, and faces: 1. Draw a line from `(0, 0.2266)` to `(0.066, 0.0382)`. 2. Draw an arc centered at `(0.0868, 0.0105)` from `(0.066, 0.0382)` to `(0.1198, 0.0)`. 3. Draw a line from `(0.1198, 0.0)` to `(0.6302, 0.0)`. 4. Draw an arc centered at `(0.6632, 0.0105)` from `(0.6302, 0.0)` to `(0.684, 0.0382)`. 5. Draw a line from `(0.684, 0.0382)` to `(0.75, 0.2266)`. 6. Draw a line from `(0.75, 0.2266)` to `(0.432, 0.2266)`. 7. Draw a line from `(0.432, 0.2266)` to `(0.432, 0.2628)`. 8. Draw a line from `(0.432, 0.2628)` to `(0.375, 0.2628)`. 9. Draw a line from `(0.375, 0.2628)` to `(0.318, 0.2628)`. 10. Draw a line from `(0.318, 0.2628)` to `(0.318, 0.2266)`. 11. Draw a line from `(0.318, 0.2266)` to `(0.0, 0.2266)`. These lines and arcs form two loops: - Loop 1: Line 1, Arc 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7, Line 8, Line 9 - Loop 2: Line 10, Arc 2, Line 11, Line 1, Arc 3, Line 12, Line 13, Line 14, Line 15, Arc 4 The loops are closed and form a single face, which is the top surface of the prism. Creating the rectangular hole For the rectangular hole in the center of the prism's side, create a new sketch on the X-Z plane (plane defined by the coordinate system). Draw a rectangle with the following vertices: - (0.318, 0.0) - (0.432, 0.0) - (0.432, 0.2628) - (0.318, 0.2628) Creating the prism Extrude the top surface and the rectangular hole sketch by 0.0362 units in the positive Z direction to create the prism. The flat bottom surface is created automatically during the extrusion process. Finalizing the part The first part is now complete. The height of the part is 0.0362 units, and the length and width are both 0.75 units. The overall shape is a rectangular prism with a curved top surface and a flat bottom surface, featuring a rectangular hole in the center of one of its sides.</description>",
