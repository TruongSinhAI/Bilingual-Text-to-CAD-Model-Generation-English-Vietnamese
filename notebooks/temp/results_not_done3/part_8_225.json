    "prompt": "<description>**Construction Instructions for the Intermediate Parts and Final Shape** Part 1: Creating a Slanted Rectangular Prism Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0, and the Translation Vector to 0.0, 0.1534, 0.0. Next, draw a 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. This sketch should result in a single face (face_1) with a loop (loop_1) containing four lines. The lines should connect the following points: 1. Start Point: [0.0,0.0], End Point: [0.75,0.0] 2. Start Point: [0.75,0.0], End Point: [0.75,0.3409] 3. Start Point: [0.75,0.3409], End Point: [0.0,0.3409] 4. Start Point: [0.0,0.3409], End Point: [0.0,0.0] After the 2D sketch has been created, scale it using a scaling factor of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the defined coordinate system parameters (euler_angles and translation_vector). Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion should extend towards the normal with a depth of 0.1534 and should not extend in the opposite direction (extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0). The height of the final object is 0.75 units and its width is 0.3409 (based on the extrusion depth towards the normal). The length of the part can be calculated as the product of the sketch scale and the total number of explicit line, arc, or circle components in the sketch. In this case, there is only one type of component, a line, and there are four instances of it, so the total length of the part is 0.75 (the sketch scale) multiplied by 4 (the number of lines in the sketch), resulting in a length of 3.0 units. Part 2: Forming Two Circular Cutouts Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 180.0, 0.0, -90.0, and the Translation Vector to 0.6631, 0.1534, 0.0528. Next, create two circular faces in two separate sketches (face_1 and face_2) on the plane defined by the coordinate system. Each sketch should result in a single face with a single loop (loop_1) containing a circle. The circles should have the following center points and radii: For face_1: Center: [0.1176,0.1176], Radius: 0.1176 For face_2: Center: [0.4585,0.1176], Radius: 0.1176 After the 2D sketches have been created, extrude the sketches with a depth of 0.3409 towards the opposite direction of normal (extude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0). The length and width of the circular cutouts are 0.5761 (depth of the extrusion) and 0.3409 (width of the part), respectively. The height of the part can be determined by the number of loops in the associated sketch. In this case, there is only one loop, so the height of the cutouts is the same as the height of the sketch, which is the same as the height of part 1 (0.75 units). Part 3: Creating a Rectangular Prism with Two Circular Cutouts Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 180.0, 0.0, -90.0, and the Translation Vector to 0.6869, 0.1534, 0.0256. Next, create a 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. This sketch should result in three enclosed loops (loop_1, loop_2, and loop_3) on a</description>",
