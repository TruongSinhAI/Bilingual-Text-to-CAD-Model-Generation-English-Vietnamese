The coordinate system represents the orientation and position of the sketch plane for part 2. Step 2: Draw 2D Sketch Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system created in step 1. The sketch will consist of one face (face\\\\_1). Step 3: Create Loops On face\\\\_1, create a loop (loop\\\\_1) with the following curves: * Line: Start Point (0, 0) and End Point (0.1875, 0) * Line: Start Point (0.1875, 0) and End Point (0.1875, 0.375) * Line: Start Point (0.1875, 0.375) and End Point (0, 0.375) * Line: Start Point (0.0, 0.375) and End Point (0, 0) Step 4: Constrain and Close Loop Ensure that the start point of each curve is connected to its adjacent curve's end point. This step forms a closed loop. Step 5: Scale Sketch Scale the 2D sketch by 0.375 (sketch\\\\_scale). Step 6: Transform Sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch with its orientation represented by the coordinate system created in step 1. Step 7: Perform Cut Extrusion Perform a cut extrusion operation on the 3D shape created in part 1 (final_shape). Extrude the 3D sketch by a depth of 0.3412 units, in the opposite direction to the normal vector. </description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: From the description, there are two distinct parts: \\\"Part 1\\\" (Rectangular Prism) and \\\"Part 2\\\" (Rectangular Prism Pocket).
