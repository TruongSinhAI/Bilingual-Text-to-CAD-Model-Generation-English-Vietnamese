Final shape dimens ions: - Length: 0.3819 units - Width: 0.3614 units - Height: 0.3819 units The final shape will be a flat rectangular metal plate with a slightly tapered shape, narrower at the top. There will be two equal holes on the top wider portion and one hole on the bottom narrower portion, all aligned with the edges of the plate.
