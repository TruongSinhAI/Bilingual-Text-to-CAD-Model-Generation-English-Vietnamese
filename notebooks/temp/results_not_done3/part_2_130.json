This matches the JSON for `part_2.coordinate_system`.\\n  - HOWEVER, the description subsequently states for transformation: \"\n                        ,\"*Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following Euler angles and translation vector:* * Euler Angles: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 * Translation Vector: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\"\n                        ,\". This contradicts the coordinate system defined earlier for part 2 in the description, and also does not match the transformation implied by the JSON's `part_2.coordinate_system` (which is the one actually used for transformation in the CAD model).\\n\\n- Conclusion:\\n  - While most details align, the explicit instruction for a (0,0,0) transformation for part 2 in the description directly contradicts the defined coordinate system for part 2 in the JSON. This significant discrepancy means the description does not perfectly match the JSON for part 2's transformation.
