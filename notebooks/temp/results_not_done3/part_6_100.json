Although the coordinates form a closed loop that approximates the intended shape, the geometric primitive type (line vs. arc) does not match the description. This constitutes a mismatch.\\n\\n--Extrusion: All parameters (depths, scale, operation) match or are correctly inferred.\\n\\n-Correction: The JSON's representation of `face_2` in Part 2, specifically using two straight line segments instead of an arc as described, is a discrepancy. While the overall shape might be similar, the explicit mention of an \\\"arc\\\" in the description indicates a mismatch in the geometric definition. The `valid` status should reflect this.\\n</think>"
