    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly curved side. The final shape is a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly curved side. It appears to be a simple, two-dimensional shape with straight edges and right angles. The object is centered and occupies a significant portion of the image. The height, width, and length of this part are 0.75 units, 0.0234 units, and 0.75 units, respectively. To create this part, follow these steps: 1. Create a new coordinate system, using the following parameters: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0234, 0.0] 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. 3. Within the sketch, create a new face (face_1). 4. Within this face, create a loop (loop_1) consisting of the following lines: - line_1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] - line_2: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0547] - line_3: [0.75, 0.0547] to [0.0, 0.0547] - line_4: [0.0, 0.0547] to [0.0, 0.0] In the next steps, you will transform the 2D sketch into a 3D model. 5. Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter sketch_scale, resulting in a scale factor of 0.75. 6. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and translation vector [0.0, 0.0234, 0.0]. 7. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following extrusion parameters: - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0234 - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 Once you finish these steps, the first intermediate CAD part will be complete. Note that this part will be used as the base for further parts and the boolean operation to combine it with the preceding CAD models is a \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\".</description>",
