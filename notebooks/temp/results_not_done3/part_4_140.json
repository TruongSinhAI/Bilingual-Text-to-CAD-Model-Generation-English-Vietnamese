This sets the orientation and position of the sketch plane. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Create a new sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. First, create a rectangle by drawing four lines as follows: - Line 1: Start Point {0.0, 0.0}, End Point {0.75, 0.0} - Line 2: Start Point {0.75, 0.0}, End Point {0.75, 0.75} - Line 3: Start Point {0.75, 0.75}, End Point {0.0, 0.75} - Line 4: Start Point {0.0, 0.75}, End Point {0.0, 0.0} These lines form the perimeter of the rectangular part.

This scales down the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. This orients and positions the sketched shape in 3D space. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by a value of 0.1875. This results in a rectangular prism-like shape with height 0.1875 units. Additionally, apply a \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" as the boolean operation. This creates a new solid body with this part. The first part consists of a rectangular prism with two circles.
