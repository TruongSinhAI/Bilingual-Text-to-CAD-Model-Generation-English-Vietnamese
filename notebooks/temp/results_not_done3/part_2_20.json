    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: CAD model of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole** **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** The first step in creating this part is to define a new coordinate system. For this part, use the default euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and a translation vector of (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Next, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single face, face_1, with one loop, loop_1. The loop is a closed series of lines and arcs. - **line_1:** The first curve in the loop is a line from (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0). - **line_2:** The second curve is a line from (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0398). - **arc_1:** The third curve is an arc that starts at (0.75, 0.0398) and ends at (0.5341, 0.2557). The mid point of the arc is at (0.6868, 0.1924). - **line_3:** The fourth curve is a line from (0.5341, 0.2557) to (0.2159, 0.2557). - **arc_2:** The fifth curve is an arc that starts at (0.2159, 0.2557) and ends at (0.0, 0.0398). The mid point of the arc is at (0.0632, 0.1924). - **line_4:** The sixth and final curve in the loop is a line from (0.0, 0.0398) to (0.0, 0.0) that closes the loop. **Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system as the reference. The euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system will be applied to the 2D sketch, creating a 3D sketch in the same position and orientation as the coordinate system. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** The final step is to extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis (towards the normal) of the coordinate system. The extrusion depth is 0.0114, and there is no extrusion in the opposite direction of the normal. Scale the sketch by 0.75 before extrusion. This part is a block with a cylindrical hole in the center. The block has a flat bottom and a flat top. The height of the block is approximately twice the width. The width of the block is approximately half the height. The cylindrical hole is centered along the diagonal axis of the block. The height of the cylindrical hole is 0.0114. The final shape is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center, positioned diagonally from the bottom left to the top right corner of the image. The cylindrical hole is centered along the diagonal axis of the prism. The prism has a flat bottom and a flat top. The height of the prism is approximately twice the width. The width of the prism is approximately half the height. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of approximately half the width of the prism.</description>",
