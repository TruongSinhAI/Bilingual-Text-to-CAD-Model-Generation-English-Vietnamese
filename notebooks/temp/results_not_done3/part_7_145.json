The dimensions of the object are approximately 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1.5 units in height. It is centered on a white background. *Step 1: Create a 2D sketch* Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.375, 0.0). This will position the sketch at the correct location for extrusion.

The second part is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom and a smooth surface, with dimensions 0.225x0.225x0.6. **Step 3: Extrude the 2D sketch** The final shape is a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, connected by a cylindrical section. The cylindrical section has a series of ridges along its length and a height of 0.15. The top and bottom have a diameter of 0.75 and a height of 0. The ridges have a height of 0.15 and a pitch of 0.225. The final shape has a height of 0.45, width of 0.75 and length of 1.0. It is a solid, opaque object with a smooth surface.
