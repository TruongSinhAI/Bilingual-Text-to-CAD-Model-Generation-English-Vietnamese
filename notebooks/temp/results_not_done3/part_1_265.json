Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following settings: - Euler angles: x=-90°, y=0°, z=-90° - Translation vector: x=0, y=0, z=0 Step 2: Create the 2D sketch for the base. Create a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Step 3: Draw the shape for the base. Draw a shape using the following lines to create a flat base with a pointed top: Line 1: [0, 0] to [0.75, 0] Line 2: [0.75, 0] to [0.75, 0.1875] Line 3: [0.75, 0.1875] to [0.375, 0.375] Line 4: [0.375, 0.375] to [0, 0.375] Line 5: [0, 0.375] to [0, 0] (This results in a closed loop with 5 line segments.) Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch. Apply a uniform scale to the whole sketch using the sketch scaling parameter: 0.75 Step 5: Transform the 2D sketch into 3D. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D using the following parameters (euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system): - Euler angles: x=-90°, y=0°, z=-90° - Translation vector: x=0, y=0, z=0 Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use the extrusion depth parameters to create the 3D model: - Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0156 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0 - Sketch scale: 0.75 Final Shape Using the intermediate part created above, you can now proceed to create the final shape according to the natural language description. Repeat the same steps for any additional parts and combine their outputs as needed. - A simple, three-dimensional, geometric shape with a flat base and a pointed top. - Length: 0.0156 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.75</description>",
