Step 1: Create the coordinate system Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: - Euler Angles: (-90.0, 0.0, -90.0) - Translation Vector: (0.0409, 0.075, 0.0341) Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch On the XY plane of the created coordinate system, draw two circles with the following properties: - Face 1: * Loop 1: + Circle 1: (0.0273, 0.0273), Radius: 0.0273 - Face 2: * Loop 1: + Circle 1: (0.5727, 0.0273), Radius: 0.0273 Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the drawn sketch by a factor of 0.6. Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.0205 in the opposite direction of the normal.</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description details two distinct parts, \"\n      ,\"Part 1\"\n      ,\" and \"\n      ,\"Part 2\"\n      ,\".\\n\\npart_1:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 1\"\n      ,\").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0205, 0.0, 0.0] (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 1\"\n      ,\").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 2\"\n      ,\").\\n----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.1227] (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 2\"\n      ,\").\\n----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.1227], End [0.0, 0.1227] (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 2\"\n      ,\").\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.1227], End [0.0, 0.0] (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 2\"\n      ,\").\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0102 (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 5\"\n      ,\" as \"\n      ,\"0.0102 both towards and opposite the normal direction\"\n      ,\").\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0102 (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 5\"\n      ,\").\\n--sketch_scale: 0.75 (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 3\"\n      ,\").\\n--operation: \"\n      ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n      ,\" (Inferred from \"\n      ,\"Extrude... to generate the 3D model\"\n      ,\" for the first part).\\n\\npart_2:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 1\"\n      ,\").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0409, 0.075, 0.0341] (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 1\"\n      ,\").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1:\\n---loop_1:\\n----circle_1: Center [0.0273, 0.0273], Radius 0.0273 (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 2\"\n      ,\").\\n--face_2:\\n---loop_1:\\n----circle_1: Center [0.5727, 0.0273], Radius 0.0273 (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 2\"\n      ,\").\\n-extrusion:\\n--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0 (Inferred from \"\n      ,\"in the opposite direction of the normal\"\n      ,\").\\n--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0205 (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 4\"\n      ,\").\\n--sketch_scale: 0.6 (Explicitly stated in \"\n      ,\"Step 3\"\n      ,\").\\n--operation: \"\n      ,\"CutFeatureOperation\"\n      ,\" (Inferred from \"\n      ,\"A rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center\"\n      ,\" in Part 1's description, implying Part 2 acts as a cut to create the hole).\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Part 1 Verification:\\n--Coordinate system: Euler Angles and Translation Vector match precisely with the JSON.\\n--Sketch: The four lines form a closed rectangular loop, with line endpoints connecting sequentially (Line 1 End = Line 2 Start, etc., and Line 4 End = Line 1 Start).
