    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center Create a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of [0, 0, 0]. 1. **Sketching the base:** - Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane. - Draw a rectangle with the following vertices: (0, 0), (0.75, 0), (0.75, 0.75), and (0, 0.75). This forms `face_1`. - Draw a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.0586. This creates `loop_2` and the circle forms a hole in the rectangle. 2. **Extruding the sketch:** - Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.2344 units, creating a 3D shape with the top surface at Z=0.2344. Part 2: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center (modified) Change the coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of [0.0234, 0.0234, 0.2344]. 1. **Sketching the base:** - Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane. - Draw a rectangle with the following vertices: (0, 0), (0.7031, 0), (0.7031, 0.7031), and (0, 0.7031). This forms `face_1`. - Draw a circle centered at (0.3516, 0.3516) with a radius of 0.0586. This creates `loop_2` and the circle forms a hole in the rectangle. 2. **Extruding the sketch:** - Subtractively extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.1875 units, removing material from the existing part. This results in a 3D shape with the top surface at Z=0.0469 (0.2344 - 0.1875). Make sure to perform a cut operation on the existing part. This completes the CAD instructions for the given JSON, creating a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a centered cylindrical hole that is slightly modified in the second part. The final shape measures (approximately) 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.2344 units in length, width, and height, respectively. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of about 0.1172 units and a depth of approximately 0.1875 units on the Z-axis.</description>",
