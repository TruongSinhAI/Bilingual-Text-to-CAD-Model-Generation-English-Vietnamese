The top is slightly wider than the bottom. The object has a smooth surface and appears to be made of a solid material.* 1. **Create a new coordinate system** with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.1929, 0.3689, 0.2146] 2. **Create a 2D sketch** on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. 3. **Draw two circles** for the top and bottom of the cylindrical object: * Circle 1: Center at (0.1604, 0.1604), radius 0.1604 Note: The cylindrical object has a tapered top and a flat bottom. This means that the circular base at the bottom is the original size, while the top circle has been scaled down to create a tapered effect. The sketch scale for this part is 0.3207. The \"operation\" is \"JoinFeatureOperation\", which means the cylindrical object is added to the existing CAD model. In summary, you first construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism and then create a cylindrical object with a tapered top and flat bottom. The objects share the same coordinate system as the final shape, which is a cylindrical object with a conical top, placed on a rectangular base. The cone and the cylindrical object are combined to form the final shape.</description>",
