The object has a cylindrical hole on one end and a tapered top and a flared base. The length is 0.75 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0647 units. **Detailed Instructions** 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. 2. Draw the first sketch on the XY plane. This sketch defines the base of the object. 3. Create a loop (loop_1) consisting of four lines and two arcs, in the following order: a. Arc from point (0.0517, 0) with endpoint (0.0517, 0.1034) and midpoint (0.0, 0.0517). b. Line from point (0.0517, 0.1034) to point (0.0517, 0.0776). c.
