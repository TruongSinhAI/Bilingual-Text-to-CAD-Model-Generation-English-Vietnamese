The second rectangle has dimensions of 0.3516 x 0.0234 units. For the first rectangle: Curve 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0234, 0.0] Curve 2: Start Point [0.0234, 0.0], End Point [0.0234, 0.0234] Curve 3: Start Point [0.0234, 0.0234], End Point [0.0, 0.0234] Curve 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0234], End Point [0.0, 0.0] For the second rectangle: Curve 1: Start Point [0.0249, 0.0015], End Point [0.3472, 0.0015] Curve 2: Start Point [0.3472, 0.0015], End Point [0.3472, 0.022] Curve 3: Start Point [0.3472, 0.022], End Point [0.0249, 0.022] Curve 4: Start Point [0.0249, 0.022], End Point [0.0249, 0.0015] The two rectangles form a single face with two loops. Loop 1 consists of lines 1, 2, and 3 and Line 4 connects back to the Start Point of Line 1, closing the loop. Loop 2 consists of lines 5, 6, and 7, and Line 8 connects back to the Start Point of Line 5, closing the loop. Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.0234. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model. Set the depth of extrusion to 0.1875 units in both the normal and opposite normal directions. The final shape is a long, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, having dimensions of 0.375 units in length, 0.0234 units in width, and 0.0234 units in height.</description>",
