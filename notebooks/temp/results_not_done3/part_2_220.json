Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 * Translation Vector: 0.0, 0.7241, 0.0 Next, create the 2D sketch for the prism on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch contains one face (face\\\\_1) which is a rectangle. The rectangle is made up of four lines: * Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.3738, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point (0.3738, 0.0), End Point (0.3738, 0.3738) * Line 3: Start Point (0.3738, 0.3738), End Point (0.0, 0.3738) * Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.3738), End Point (0.0, 0.0) Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.3738. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.3786 units to create the 3D model of the rectangular prism. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. Part 2: Smaller Rectangular Prism Construct a smaller rectangular prism on top of the first prism, such that it intersects with the top face of the first prism. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 * Translation Vector: 0.0, 0.3455, 0.0 Next, create the 2D sketch for the smaller prism on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system.

Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.1634 units to create the 3D model of the smaller rectangular prism. The smaller prism intersects with the top face of the larger prism, resulting in a triangular cutout on the top face of the larger prism. The dimensions of the smaller prism are approximately 0.5 units in length, 0.3 units in width, and 0.2 units in height. Final Shape: Rectangular Prism with Triangular Cutout The final shape is a rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one of its faces. The cutout is located on the top face of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are 4 units by 6 units by 8 units. The triangular cutout is 2 units by 3 units. The cutout is centered on the top face of the prism.
