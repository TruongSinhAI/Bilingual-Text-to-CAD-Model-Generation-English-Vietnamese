Perform a scale transformation on the 2D sketch with a scaling parameter of 0.75. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.375 units in the opposite direction of the normals.

Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 3: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** 1. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch, using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch** 1. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.0149 units in the direction of the normal, and by 0 units in the opposite direction. 2. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 3. The resulting 3D model is a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom, with a cylindrical hole in the center, and a smaller rectangular prism attached to the top of the larger one. The smaller prism is also attached to a flat surface at the bottom of the larger prism. The overall dimensions of the larger prism are approximately 4 units long, 2 units wide, and 1 unit tall. Note: The final shape is not a simple rectangular prism and requires a more complex set of instructions to generate an accurate CAD model. The detailed instructions provided above will help you in generating a precise CAD model.</description>",
