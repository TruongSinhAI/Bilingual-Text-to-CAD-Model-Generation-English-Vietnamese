Step 3: Draw a rectangle in the sketch Draw a rectangle in the sketch by creating the following lines and connecting them end-to-end to form a loop: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.4714] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.4714], End Point [0.0, 0.4714] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.4714], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This rectangle consists of 4 lines and forms a single loop. The loop is closed, meaning the start and end points of each line are connected. Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. Step 5: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Rotate the scaled 2D sketch using the euler angles of the coordinate system. Translate the scaled 2D sketch using the translation vector of the coordinate system. Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to a depth of 0.0536 units. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with the following dimensions: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.0536 units - Height: 0.75 units The final shape that you have determined is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides of the prism are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. The height of the intermediate part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.0536 units, and the length is 0.75 units.
