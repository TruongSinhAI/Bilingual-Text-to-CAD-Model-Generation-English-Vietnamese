This implies a \"\n            ,\"sketch_scale\"\n            ,\" of 1.0, or the description is missing an explicit scaling instruction.

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. We will create a new coordinate system with a rotation of 0 degrees in the X and Y axes, and -90 degrees in the Z axis. The coordinate system will be translated by 0 units in the X axis, 0.5 units in the Y axis, and 0 units in the Z axis. Sketch: Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane. 1. Draw a line starting from (0, 0) and ending at (0.75, 0). 2. Draw a line starting from (0.75, 0) and ending at (0.75, 0.25). 3. Draw a line starting from (0.75, 0.25) and ending at (0.5, 0.25). 4. Draw a line starting from (0.5, 0.25) and ending at (0.25, 0.625). 5. Draw a line starting from (0.25, 0.625) and ending at (0, 0.625). 6. Draw a line starting from (0, 0.625) and ending at (0, 0). Extrusion: 1. Scale the sketch by 0.75. 2. Extrude the sketch by 0.5 units in the positive Z direction. 3. Set the operation to create a new solid body. The length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.5 units, and the height is 0.75 units. Final Shape: The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. This shape is constructed by Part 1. Instructions Summary: Follow the instructions for Part 1 to construct the prism shape. Allow for a slight taper on the top and bottom of the prism by adjusting the euler angles as detailed in the instructions. Once Part 1 is complete, the final shape is achieved. Keep the shape, length, width, and height consistent throughout the design process, as per the provided information. If necessary, scale each part in the same manner, as a multiple of the previous part. The first part should have a scale factor of 0.75, as stated in the instructions. Maintain this scaling approach moving forward to ensure the correct dimensions of the final shape.</description>",
