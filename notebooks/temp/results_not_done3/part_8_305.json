The dimensions of the prism are 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height. The curved side has a radius of 0.5 units. The first part (slightly tapered rectangular prism) is joined to the second part (three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a front face angled at 45 degrees) to form the final shape. Please note that in the description of the final shape provided, some curves are not explicitly mentioned. However, from the provided JSON, it is evident that the curves in the second part are arcs that form a quarter circle on the Y-Z plane, and the curve in the first part is a curved surface with a radius of 0.5 units on the X-Z plane.</description>",

For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and a single loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face. The loop should consist of the following line segments: - line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.4382, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.4382, 0.0], End Point = [0.4382, 0.3234] - line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.4382, 0.3234], End Point = [0.0, 0.3234] - line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.3234], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] After creating the loop, scale the sketch using the scaling parameter 0.4382. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector to a depth of 0.3324 to generate the 3D model. With the extrusion complete, the first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners, dimensions as: - length: 0.4382 - width: 0.4382 - height: 0.3324 **Part 2: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with Hollow Center** For part 2, create a new coordinate system with the euler angles set to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0], and the translation vector set to [0.4432, 0.0, 0.3324]. Create a new face (face\\\\_1) and a single loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face for the sketch. The loop should consist of the following line segments: - line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.3234, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.3234, 0.0], End Point = [0.1617, 0.4176] - line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.1617, 0.4176], End Point = [0.0541, 0.2894] - line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.0541, 0.2894], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Scale the sketch using the scaling parameter 0.4176. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the opposite direction of the normal vector to a depth of 0.4432 to create the hollow center in the 3D model. The resulting second part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a hollow center, dimensions as: - length: 0.4432 - width: 0.4176 - height: 0.4176</description>",
