This loop consists of 3 straight lines. 1. line_1: Start Point at [0.0, 0.0], End Point at [0.375, 0.5] 2. line_2: Start Point at [0.375, 0.5], End Point at [0.0, 0.5] 3. line_3: Start Point at [0.0, 0.5], End Point at [0.0, 0.0] Transform the 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles of [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and translation vector of [0.75, 0.0, 0.125]. Extrude the 2D sketch with an extrusion depth toward the normal of 0.0, extrusion depth opposite normal 0.5, and sketch scale of 0.5. This is a \"CutFeatureOperation\". The final shape of the part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. Final shape: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners and a slightly tapered top Generate a new coordinate system for the final shape. Combine parts 1 and 2 by performing the appropriate boolean operations (refer to Part 1 and Part 2 instructions), resulting in a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners and a slightly tapered top. The dimensions are as follows: 1. Length: 0.75 2. Width: 0.5 3. Height: 0.75</description>",
