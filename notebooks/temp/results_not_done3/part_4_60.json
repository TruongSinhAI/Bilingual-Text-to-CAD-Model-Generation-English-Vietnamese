Part 2: Cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 2 based on part 1. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.225, 0.375, 0.075]. Drawing the 2D sketch: 1. Create a new face for the sketch. 2. Circle 1, center (0.15, 0.15), and radius 0.15 to create the larger circle. 3. Circle 2, centered at the same point, with a radius of 0.1125 to create the smaller circle. Notes: - Loop 1 consists of circle 1. - Loop 2 consists of circle 2. - Face 1 is bounded by loops 1 and 2. Transform the 2D sketch: 1. Scale the sketch by 0.3 using the sketch_scale. 2. Apply the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system to the scaled 2D sketch, transforming it into a 3D sketch. Extrude the 3D sketch: 1.

Start by drawing the 2D sketch on the XY plane of the created coordinate system, yielding the following face: * Face 1 3. On Face 1, create Loop 1 by combining the following lines and arcs, forming a closed loop: * Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.1875, 0.0] * Line 2: [0.1875, 0.0] to [0.1875, 0.75] * Line 3: [0.1875, 0.75] to [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: [0.0, 0.75] to [0.0, 0.0] 4. Scale the drawn 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch by applying the following Euler angles and translation vector. 6. Extrude the 3D Sketch such that the depth towards the normal is 0.0094 and the depth opposite the normal is also 0.0094, creating a new solid body. **Final Shape Instructions** **Shape:** A rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The sloped side is at a 45 degree angle. 1. Construct a new coordinate system with the provided parameters. 2. Create Face 1 using the given 2D sketch with its closed loop. 3. Scale and transform Face 1 into a 3D Sketch. 4. Extrude the 3D Sketch to generate the final shape, according to the height specification. *Length*: 2 units *Width*: 1 unit *Height*: 0.5 units</description>",
