    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1 Instructions** **Shape** Construct a circular metal ring with four evenly spaced holes around its circumference. **Step 1: Creating the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0115, 0.0] **Step 2: Drawing the 2D sketch** Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. **Step 3: Circular loop** 1. Draw a circle at (0.1846, 0.1846) with a radius of 0.1846. This will create a loop with a single circle (loop_1, circle_1). **Step 4: Four Arc loops** 1. Draw an arc from (0.0718, 0.0858) to (0.0858, 0.0718) with a midpoint of (0.0715, 0.0715). This forms the first arc of loop_2, arc_1. 2. Draw an arc from (0.0858, 0.0718) to (0.2834, 0.0718) with midpoints as (0.1846, 0.0346) and (0.2977, 0.0715) for arc_2 and arc_3 respectively. 3. Draw an arc from (0.2834, 0.0718) to (0.2975, 0.0858) with a midpoint of (0.3346, 0.1846), which forms arc_4. 4. Draw an arc from (0.2975, 0.0858) to (0.2834, 0.2834) with midpoints as (0.2977, 0.2977) and (0.2837, 0.2837) for arc_5 and arc_6 respectively. 5. Draw an arc from (0.2834, 0.2975) to (0.0858, 0.2975) with midpoints as (0.1846, 0.3346) and (0.0856, 0.2837) for arc_7 and arc_8 respectively. 6. Connect the endpoint of the last arc with the starting point of the first arc to create a closed loop. **Step 5: Creating two centered loops** 1. Draw a circle with center at (0.1846, 0.1846) and radius 0.1292 for both loop_1 and loop_2 in face_3. 2. Repeat the previous step for face_4 with the same center and radius of 0.1177. **Step 6: Extrusion** * Extrude the sketch along the normal direction with a depth of 0.0115. * Scale the sketch by 0.3692. * Set the extrusion operation as a 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'. The final part should have a height of 0.3692, a width of 0.0115, and a length of 0.3692 as described in the metadata.</description>",

Correct.\\n--face_1, loop_2 (arcs):\\n---The description of arcs (e.g., \"\n    ,\"midpoints as (0.1846, 0.0346) and (0.2977, 0.0715) for arc_2 and arc_3 respectively\"\n    ,\" and \"\n    ,\"Draw an arc from (0.2834, 0.0718) to (0.2975, 0.0858) with a midpoint of (0.3346, 0.1846), which forms arc_4\"\n    ,\") is confusing and contains inconsistencies with the JSON. For example, the start point for arc_4 in the description (0.2834, 0.0718) does not match the JSON (0.2975, 0.0858). There are multiple mismatches in start/end points and sometimes midpoints for arcs 4 through 8 between the description and JSON for face_1, loop_2. The description also lacks clear articulation of all 8 arcs. This is a significant mismatch.\\n--face_2, loop_1 (arcs):\\n---Similar to face_1, loop_2, the description's phrasing is convoluted, stating midpoints for multiple arcs in one line. While arcs 1, 2, and 3's values align, the description *omits* details for arcs 4 through 8 in face_2, loop_1, despite them being present in the JSON. This is an omission.\\n--face_2, loop_2 (circle):\\n---The description *completely omits* any mention of face_2, loop_2. This is a significant omission.\\n--face_3, loop_1 and loop_2 (circles):\\n---Description states: \"\n    ,\"Draw a circle with center at (0.1846, 0.1846) and radius 0.1292 for both loop_1 and loop_2 in face_3\"\n    ,\". JSON for face_3, loop_1, circle_1 has radius 0.1292 (Match). However, JSON for face_3, loop_2, circle_1 has radius 0.1177 (Mismatch).\\n--face_4, loop_1 and loop_2 (circles):\\n---Description states: \"\n    ,\"Repeat the previous step for face_4 with the same center and radius of 0.1177\"\n    ,\" (implying both get 0.1177). JSON for face_4, loop_1, circle_1 has radius 0.1292 (Mismatch). JSON for face_4, loop_2, circle_1 has radius 0.1177 (Match).\\n\\n-Correction: The description has multiple significant mismatches and omissions regarding the detailed geometry of the sketch, particularly for the arcs in face_1 and face_2, and the radii for circles in face_3 and face_4. Therefore, the description does not accurately reflect the JSON.\\n</think>"
