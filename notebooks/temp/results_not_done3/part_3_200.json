Extrude the Sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.0372 units. The operation is to create a new solid body. Describe the Part The part is a rectangular prism with a curved top edge. The dimensions are: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.0372 units This part is the base part. Future parts will build upon the previously constructed part.</description>",
