Step 2: Create the first face Create the first face of the part by drawing a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. The sketch should contain a rectangle with vertices at points (0.0, 0.0), (0.75, 0.0), (0.75, 0.75), (0.0, 0.75). A total of four lines make up this rectangle as line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4. Step 3: Create the second face In the same 2D sketch, create the second face by drawing a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.125 units. Step 4: Constrain the loops and faces * Loop_1: Ensure that the lines are connected in a closed loop where line_4 connects to line_1. * Loop_2: Connect the endpoints of the arc to form a circle and ensure it is concentric with the rectangle from Loop_1. * Face_1: Connect the lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4) to form a rectangle. * Face_2: Connect the arc to form a circle within the rectangle. Step 5: Scale the 2D sketch Apply a uniform scaling transformation to the entire 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. Step 6: Define the Euler angles and position Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and the translation vector to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 to maintain the current position and orientation of the scaled 2D sketch for the next steps.
