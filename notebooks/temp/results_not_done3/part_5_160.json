In this case, extrude the sketch 0.1453 units in the direction of the normal and do not extrude in the opposite direction. Apply a scaling factor of 0.7113 to the sketch before and after extrusion. Final notes on the part design The overall shape of this part represents a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom and a curved side. The flat top and bottom are parallel to the X-Y plane, and the cylindrical side has a rectangular hole. The hole is created by the inner circular loops shown in the sketch. The part is symmetrical along its central Z-axis. The length, width, and height are equal, representing the overall dimensions of the part.</description>",
