The first arc should start at the point (0, 0.0894), go through the midpoint (0.097, 0), and end at the point (0.1938, 0.0894). The second arc should start at the point (0.1938, 0.5354), go through the midpoint (0.0967, 0.6248), and end at the point (0, 0.5349). These arcs form loop 1. Close the loops and complete the sketch. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6248. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by a depth of 0.323 towards the normal and 0 towards the opposite direction of the normal.

Create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. Begin by sketching a circle with center (0.0836, 0.0836) and radius 0.0836, which forms face 1.
