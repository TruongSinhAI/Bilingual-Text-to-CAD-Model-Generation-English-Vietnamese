The sketch will consist of several lines and circles, as described below. **Step 3: Draw the outer boundary of the rectangular metal bracket** Begin by drawing a line from the origin (0,0) to (0.1429, 0). This line represents the left edge of the rectangular metal bracket. Next, draw a line from (0.1429, 0) to (0.1429, 0.2143). This line represents the bottom edge of the rectangular metal bracket. Then, draw a line from (0.1429, 0.2143) to (0.6071, 0.2143). This line represents the right edge of the rectangular metal bracket. Finally, draw a line from (0.6071, 0.2143) to (0.6071, 0). This line represents the top edge of the rectangular metal bracket. Close the loop by drawing a line from (0.6071, 0) to the origin (0, 0). **Step 4: Draw the four holes in the rectangular metal bracket** Draw the first hole by drawing a circle centered at (0.1964, 0.4107) with a radius of 0.0536. Draw the second hole by drawing a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.0714. Draw the third hole by drawing a circle centered at (0.5536, 0.4107) with a radius of 0.0536. **Step 5: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 6: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following Euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.1429, 0.0] **Step 7: Extrude the 3D sketch to create the rectangular metal bracket** Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.1429 units in the positive Z direction, creating the rectangular metal bracket. The final shape will be a 3D model of a rectangular metal bracket with four holes evenly spaced along its length, with a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.1429 units, and a height of 0.2143 units.</description>",
