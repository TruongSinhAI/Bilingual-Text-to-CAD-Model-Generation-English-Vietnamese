    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Start by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 degrees and the translation vector to 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Sketching the base profile: Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 1. Draw a rectangle as follows: * Line 1: Start at (0.0, 0.0) and end at (0.75, 0.0) * Line 2: Start at (0.75, 0.0) and end at (0.75, 0.25) * Line 3: Start at (0.75, 0.25) and end at (0.0, 0.25) * Line 4: Start at (0.0, 0.25) and end at (0.0, 0.0) 3D Model Generation: Extrude the base profile along the Z-axis to produce the final shape using the following properties: * Extrusion depth toward the normal: 0.0 * Extrusion depth opposite the normal: 0.0281 This creates the desired rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The height, width, and length of the prism should be 0.5, 1, and 2 units respectively, except for the \"exposed\" 0.0281 unit section, which has a width of 0.0281 units. The prism is centered on a white background. Note: The JSON provided does not contain a base or a final shape. The following instructions are generally valid for any base and final shape. Base: Construct a shape according to the base JSON Start by creating a new coordinate system. Set all 3 Euler angles to 0.0. The translation vector should match the JSON data. Sketching the base: Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Refer to the JSON data to identify the loops and shapes present in the base. The base typically consists of a combination of lines, arcs, and circles and usually consists of multiple loops. Number the loops clockwise when looking from the positive Z-direction. For each loop: 1. Identify the components (lines/arcs/circles) and list the start and end points or midpoints as provided. 2. Sketch the components for each loop in the correct order, and specify any constraints based on the JSON data (e.g., 'line_1''s endpoint is equal to 'line_2''s start point). 3D Model Generation: Extrude the complete base through the positive Z-direction by the height specified in the JSON data. This generates the initial 3D model. Intermediate Parts: Construct shapes based on the parts JSON For each intermediate part, create a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles and translation vector using the reference parts and apply any required scaling or boolean operations based on the JSON data. Sketching: Create a new sketch on the XY plane from the new coordinate system. Check if there is a reference part to sketch relative to: 1. If yes, create the sketch on the geometry of the reference part described (e.g., a plane perpendicular to an edge, a plane tangent to a surface, etc.). 2. If no, create a new sketch relative to the current coordinate system. Identify the loops and shapes present in the part's sketch and follow the same instructions as for the base. 3D Model Generation: Extrude the part's sketch through the positive or negative Z-direction as needed based on the JSON data. Based on the extrusion information, apply any required scaling and boolean operations: * NewBodyFeatureOperation: Add the new part to the existing model. * CutFeatureOperation: Remove the intersecting material, effectively creating a cut. * IntersectFeatureOperation: Keep only the intersecting volume, merging the part with any coinciding solids. * JoinFeatureOperation: Join the new volume to any coinciding solids. Follow these procedures to generate all the intermediate parts and the final shape according to the JSON data. Ensure that the sketches and the subsequent 3D models are properly aligned and respect any scaling or boolean operations provided in the JSON data.</description>",
