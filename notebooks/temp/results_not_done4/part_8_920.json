Each circle forms a separate face in the sketch. **Step 2: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 3: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Leave the euler angles as is (0, 0, 0) and translate the sketch by (0, 0, 0). **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the scaled and transformed sketch by 0.0556 units towards the normal direction. **Part 2: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom** **Step 1: Draw the 2D sketch** Create a new coordinate system rotated by euler angles (0, 0, 0) and translated by (0.0728, 0.0261, 0).
