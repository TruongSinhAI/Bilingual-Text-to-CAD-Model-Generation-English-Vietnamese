Step 3: Draw the Curves 1. Draw arc_1 with a start point at [0.0, 0.0605], a mid point at [0.0177, 0.0177], and an end point at [0.0605, 0.0]. 2. Draw line_1 with a start point at [0.0605, 0.0], and an end point at [0.6895, 0.0]. 3. Draw arc_2 with a start point at [0.6895, 0.0], a mid point at [0.7323, 0.0177], and an end point at [0.75, 0.0605]. 4. Draw line_2 with a start point at [0.75, 0.0605], and an end point at [0.75, 0.6119]. 5. Draw arc_3 with a start point at [0.75, 0.6119], a mid point at [0.7323, 0.6547], and an end point at [0.6895, 0.6724]. 6. Draw line_3 with a start point at [0.6895, 0.6724], and an end point at [0.0605, 0.6724]. 7. Draw arc_4 with a start point at [0.0605, 0.6724], a mid point at [0.0177, 0.6547], and an end point at [0.0, 0.6119]. 8. Draw line_4 with a start point at [0.0, 0.6119], and an end point at [0.0, 0.0605]. Step 4: Create the Faces and Loops 1. Create face_1 using loop_1. 2. Loop_1 contains the following: arc_1, line_1, arc_2, line_2, arc_3, line_3, arc_4, and line_4 in that order. Step 5: Scale and Extrude the Sketch Scale the sketch using a factor of 0.75, and then extrude it by 0.1211 units in the positive Z direction (towards the normal). For the opposite direction of normals, set the depth to 0.0. This completes the construction of a three-dimensional rectangular prism. Part dimensions: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.1211</description>",
