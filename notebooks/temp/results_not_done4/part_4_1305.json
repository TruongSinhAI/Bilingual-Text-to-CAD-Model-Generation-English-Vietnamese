Final shape: The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The tapering is achieved by subtracting a smaller rectangular prism from a larger one. The dimensions of the larger rectangular prism are 0.75x0.75x1.5 units, and the smaller rectangular prism has dimensions of 0.375x0.375x0.75 units. The smaller prism is positioned at the center of the larger prism, and the height is measured from the bottom of the larger prism to the top of the smaller prism. Note: All measurements are in the same unit system, either metric or imperial. Ensure that the unit system is consistent throughout the design process.</description>",
