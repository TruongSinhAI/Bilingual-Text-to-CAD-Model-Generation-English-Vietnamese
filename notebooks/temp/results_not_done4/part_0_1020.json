The first intermediate CAD part of the assembly will have the described height, width, and length. Continuing Instructions for the complete CAD assembly: Following the construction of Part 1, use boolean operations to unite or combine new CAD components with the existing prism, depending on the \"operation\" property in the \"extrusion\" object of each new CAD part. This will generate a final three-dimensional CAD model. Remember to describe any new parts or loops as needed based on their respective CAD Assembly JSONs, as outlined in the initial instruction.</description>",
