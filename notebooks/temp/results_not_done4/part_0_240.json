    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism** The first part to construct is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The prism is centered on a white background. **Part 1: Sketching** 1. Create a new coordinate system with the Euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the Translation Vector set to [0.3748, 0.3898, 0.0]. This will position the prism slightly above the origin. 2. Draw a rectangle on the XY plane. To do this, create a loop with the following lines: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.2086, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.2086, 0.0], End Point [0.2086, 0.0083] - Line 3: Start Point [0.2086, 0.0083], End Point [0.0, 0.0083] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0083], End Point [0.0, 0.0] 3.

Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.2086 to ensure that the prism fits properly within the overall model. 2. Extrude the prism in the positive Z direction by a distance of 0.456. This will raise the prism above the XY plane, creating the desired offset. **Intermediate Part 2: Triangular Cutout** The second part to construct is a triangular cutout on one side of the prism. This triangular cutout is located on the top face of the prism. **Part 2: Sketching** 1.

Temporarily change the work plane to the XZ plane. This is the top face of the prism where the triangular cutout will be created. 3. Draw a polygon with seven sides.
