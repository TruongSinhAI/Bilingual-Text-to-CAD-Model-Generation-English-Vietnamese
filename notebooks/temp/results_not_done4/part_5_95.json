Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.5. Extrude the sketch linearly along the normal by 0.5 units. The operation creates a new solid body. **Part 2: Constructing a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, with dimensions 2 units by 3 units by 4 units.** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles [90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and translation vector [0.25, 0.5, 0.2312].

Extrude the sketch linearly along the negative normal by 0.5 units. The operation removes material from the existing body. **Final assembly: A 3D model of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism is positioned at an angle and is slightly tilted.** Combine the three parts to create the final assembly, ensuring that they align correctly at the appropriate interfaces based on their coordinate systems.

The JSON's sketch_scale of 0.3055 is consistent with 2 * radius (diameter), which is 2 * 0.1527 = 0.3054. The minor difference is likely due to rounding, making it consistent.\\n\\n- Result: All components and values inferred from the cleaned description are consistent with the JSON across all three parts.
