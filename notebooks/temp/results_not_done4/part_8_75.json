    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A Rectangular Metal Bar with Four Holes Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Create a new coordinate system for the part based on the Euler angles and translation vector provided in the JSON. The Euler angles are `[-90.0, 0.0, -90.0]` degrees and the translation vector is `[0.0625, 0.0, 0.0]`. Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch on the X-Y Plane Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Step 3: Draw the Rectangle - Draw the first line segment from `(0.0, 0.0)` to `(0.75, 0.0)`. - Draw the second line segment from `(0.75, 0.0)` to `(0.75, 0.125)`. - Draw the third line segment from `(0.75, 0.125)` to `(0.0, 0.125)`. - Draw the fourth line segment from `(0.0, 0.125)` to `(0.0, 0.0)`. Step 4: Draw the Circles - Draw the first circle with center `(0.125, 0.0625)` and radius `0.0313`. - Draw the second circle with center `(0.25, 0.0625)` and radius `0.0313`. - Draw the third circle with center `(0.375, 0.0625)` and radius `0.0313`. - Draw the fourth circle with center `(0.5, 0.0625)` and radius `0.0313`. - Draw the fifth circle with center `(0.625, 0.0625)` and radius `0.0313`. Step 5: Close the Loops - The first loop consists of the four line segments. - The second to sixth loops each consist of a single circle. Step 6: Scale the Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of `0.75` using the `sketch_scale` parameter. Step 7: Transform the Sketch into 3D and Extrude - Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the provided Euler angles and translation vector. - Extrude the sketch in the direction of the normal by a depth of `0.0625` units to create the final shape. The resulting part is a rectangular metal bar with four holes evenly spaced along its length, as described in the JSON. The part has an overall length of `0.0625` units, width of `0.75` units, and height of `0.75` units. The holes are created by the circular features in the sketch, with each hole being generated from a separate loop consisting of a single circle.</description>",
