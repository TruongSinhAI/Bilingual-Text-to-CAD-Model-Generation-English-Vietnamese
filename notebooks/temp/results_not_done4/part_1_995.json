Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extrude the sketch by 0.0625 units towards the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction of normal. The resulting shape is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole on one of its faces, represented by the shape parameter in the JSON description. The length, width, and height of intermediate part 1 are 0.75 units, 0.75 units, and 0.0625 units respectively. The final shape's length, width, and height are as described in the JSON with minor discrepancies due to the sketching process. The next sections will detail the constructing the rest of the CAD assembly as required by the JSON instructions.</description>",
