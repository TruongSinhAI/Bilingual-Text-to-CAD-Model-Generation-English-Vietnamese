    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. This will orient and position the coordinate system properly for the first part. Create the 2D sketch on this coordinate system. It will have two faces (face_1 and face_2) and each face will have a loop (loop_1). On face_1, loop_1 consists of three line segments and one arc. The line segments are the following: 1. Start Point: [0.1364, 0.0]; End Point: [0.1364, 0.2727] 2. Start Point: [0.1364, 0.2727]; End Point: [0.1364, 0.2386] The arc can be summarized as: Arc_1: Start Point: [0.1364, 0.0]; Mid Point: [0.0341, 0.1364]; End Point: [0.1364, 0.2727] Repeat this process for the line and arc components of face_2 and loop_1. Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter, sketch_scale, which is 0.2727. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the rotation information from Euler angles and the translation from the Translation Vector. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.75 units and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0.0 units. The boolean operation is a \"New Body Feature Operation\", which corresponds to creating a new solid body in the CAD model. Document the part with the provided metadata, including dimensions. **Part 2: A cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom, featuring a smooth, curved surface and a central hole running through its length** Create a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and Translation Vector to [0.75, 0.0, 0.0]. Create the 2D sketch for this part. It will have faces and loops similar to Part 1. Again, create line segments and arcs on both faces precisely as in Part 1. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.2727 and transform it into a 3D sketch using the rotation and translation information from the coordinate system. This time, however, extrude the part differently, with 0 depth towards the normal and 0.75 units opposite the normal. This will result in intersecting the existing body, as denoted by the \"Intersect Feature Operation\". Document the part with its metadata and dimensions. **Part 3: A cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. It has a smooth surface and appears to be a solid, three-dimensional shape. The object is symmetrical along its central axis** Create a new coordinate system using the same settings as Part 1. Draw the 2D sketch identically to Part 1's sketch. This will make it easier to follow the instructions while maintaining consistency. Scale the 2D sketch and convert it into a 3D sketch, as done previously. Extrude the sketch by 0.5114 units towards the normal, creating a \"Join Feature Operation\", which resembles adding material to the body. Document Part 3's metadata and dimensions as described in the JSON.</description>",

The lines should connect the following points in order: - Start Point: [0.0, 0.0] - End Point: [0.75, 0.0] - Start Point: [0.75, 0.0] - End Point: [0.75, 0.5357] - Start Point: [0.75, 0.5357] - End Point: [0.5, 0.5357] - Start Point: [0.5, 0.5357] - End Point: [0.5, 0.3571] - Start Point: [0.5, 0.3571] - End Point: [0.25, 0.3571] - Start Point: [0.25, 0.3571] - End Point: [0.25, 0.1786] - Start Point: [0.25, 0.1786] - End Point: [0.0, 0.1786] - Start Point: [0.0, 0.1786] - End Point: [0.0, 0.0] **Extrusion** 1. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 2. Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal vector by 0.3571 units. 3. Do not extrude in the opposite direction. **Description** 1. Shape: Rectangular prism with triangular cutout. 2. Length: 0.3571 3. Width: 0.75 4. Height: 0.75</description>",
