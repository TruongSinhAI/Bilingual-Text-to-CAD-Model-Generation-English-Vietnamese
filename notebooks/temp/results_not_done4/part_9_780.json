This loop forms the perimeter of the rectangular shape. **Step 5: Scale the Sketch** Scale the sketch with a scaling parameter of 0.1006. **Step 6: Transform the Sketch into a 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch, using the coordinate system information provided in Step 1. **Step 7: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal by 0.75 units.
