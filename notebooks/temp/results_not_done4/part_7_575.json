    "reasoning": "<description>**CAD Model Instructions** **Part 1: Capital Letter 'A' Structure** *Shape and Dimensions* Construct a three-dimensional, metallic, angular structure with a hollow center, resembling a capital letter 'A'. The length, width, and height of this part are 0.75 units. *Creating the Coordinate System* Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0529, 0.0] units. *Creating the Sketch* Create a new sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. *Face 1* *Loop 1* 1. Draw a line from the point [0.0, 0.0] to the point [0.0881, 0.0]. 2. Draw an arc from the point [0.0881, 0.0] to the point [0.617, 0.0] with a mid point at [0.3526, 0.1906]. 3. Draw a line from the point [0.617, 0.0] to the point [0.7052, 0.0]. 4. Draw a line from the point [0.7052, 0.0] to the point [0.5289, 0.617]. 5. Draw an arc from the point [0.5289, 0.617] to the point [0.1763, 0.617] with a mid point at [0.3526, 0.75]. 6. Draw a line from the point [0.1763, 0.617] to the point [0.0, 0.0]. *Loop 2* 1.

The connectivity is also accurate: End Point of line_1 is Start Point of arc_1, End Point of arc_1 is Start Point of line_2, End Point of line_2 is Start Point of line_3, End Point of line_3 is Start Point of arc_2, End Point of arc_2 is Start Point of line_4, and End Point of line_4 closes the loop by connecting to the Start Point of line_1.
