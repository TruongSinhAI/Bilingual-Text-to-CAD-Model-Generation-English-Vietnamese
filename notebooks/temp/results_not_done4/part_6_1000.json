    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A 3D model of a rectangular prism with a circular hole in the center Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. The euler angles should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will set the origin of the coordinate system to the bottom-left corner of the rectangular prism. Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch for the rectangular prism With the new coordinate system as the reference, draw the 2D sketch for the rectangular prism. In this sketch, there are four lines, with the following start and end points: * Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.7181, 0.0] * Line 2: [0.7181, 0.0] to [0.7181, 0.75] * Line 3: [0.7181, 0.75] to [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: [0.0, 0.75] to [0.0, 0.0] These lines form the perimeter of the rectangular prism and will be extruded to create the 3D model. Step 3: Draw the 2D sketch for the circular hole In the same 2D sketch, draw the 2D sketch for the circular hole. This is a circle with the following center point and radius: * Center: [0.359, 0.375] * Radius: 0.3191 Step 4: Scale the 2D sketches Scale the 2D sketches using the sketch scaling parameter of 0.75. This will reduce the size of the sketches by a factor of 0.75. Step 5: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector of the coordinate system. The euler angles are set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector is set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch for the rectangular prism Extrude the 2D sketch for the rectangular prism to a depth of 0.016 towards the normal. This will create the 3D model of the rectangular prism. Step 7: Extrude the 2D sketch for the circular hole Extrude the 2D sketch for the circular hole to a depth of 0.0 towards the normal. This will create the circular hole in the rectangular prism. Step 8: Define the boolean operation for the current part Define the boolean operation for the current part as \"adding material\". This means that the current part will be added to the final CAD model. Part Description The final shape of this part is a rectangular prism with a circular hole in the center. The length of the rectangular prism is 0.75, the width is 0.75, and the height is 0.016. The circular hole has a diameter of 0.6382 (2 x radius of 0.3191).</description>",
