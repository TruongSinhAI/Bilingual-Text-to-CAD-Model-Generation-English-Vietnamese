To create this part, follow these steps: **Coordinate System** 1. Create a new coordinate system. 2. Set the Euler angles: X = 0.0°, Y = 0.0°, Z = -90.0°. 3. Set the translation vector: X = 0.0, Y = 0.0094, Z = 0.0. **Sketch (Face 1)** 1. Create a new sketch on the XY plane (defined by the coordinate system). 2. Create a loop (loop_1) in the sketch. 3. Add four line segments to the loop: a. line_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.0). b. line_2: Start Point (0.75, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.1875). c. line_3: Start Point (0.75, 0.1875), End Point (0.0, 0.1875). d. line_4: Start Point (0.0, 0.1875), End Point (0.0, 0.0). *Note: Ensure all the line segments are connected end to end, creating a closed loop.* **Extrusion** 1. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 along the XY plane. 2. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis, creating a 3D model: a. Extrusion Depth Towards Normal: 0.0094 units. b. Extrusion Depth Opposite Normal: 0 units. c. Operation: This operation creates a new solid body by adding material. That concludes the construction of Part 1. Review the design for accuracy and compliance before moving on to Part 2. *Part Dimensions:* 1. Length: 0.75 units. 2. Width: 0.1875 units (scaled sketch width). 3.
