All coordinates for lines and circles match the description precisely.\\\\n- The description states \\\\\"\n            ,\"These circles will form the rounded corners of the prism.\\\\\"\n            ,\" This implies they might be cutting the corners of the rectangle. The JSON structure with separate loops within the same face is consistent with defining multiple profiles on a single sketch plane. If the circles are intended as cuts for rounded corners, the actual CAD software would interpret multiple loops on one face with the outermost loop as the boundary and inner loops as holes/cuts. The overall shape description (\\\\\"\n            ,\"rectangular prism with rounded corners and edges\\\\\"\n            ,\") is consistent with this interpretation.\\\\n- The extrusion parameters (extrude_depth_towards_normal, extrude_depth_opposite_normal, sketch_scale) are all correctly derived from the description and match the JSON.\\\\n- The operation type \\\\\"\n            ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\\\"\n            ,\" is explicitly stated and correct.\\\\n- The \\\\\"\n            ,\"Shape and Dimensions\\\\\"\n            ,\" section provided at the beginning of the description provides a high-level summary that is consistent with the detailed construction steps and the resulting JSON (e.g., height 0.5313m corresponds to the extrusion depth).\\\\n- No corrections are necessary as all elements are consistent between the description and the JSON.\\\\n</think>"
