Next, scale the 2D sketch using the sketch\\\\_scale scaling parameter of 0.0775. This will ensure that the dimensions of the object are consistent with the specified coordinate system. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use an extrude depth towards the normal of 0.75 and an extrude depth opposite normal of 0.0. The sketch scale should be set to the value used in the previous step (0.0775). The operation for this part is to create a new solid body. The overall dimensions of this part are a length of 0.0775, a width of 0.0775, and a height of 0.75.
