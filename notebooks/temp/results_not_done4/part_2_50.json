This is a discrepancy.\\n\\n- Part 2 Check:\\n  - Coordinate system matches.\\n  - Sketch details (all six faces with their respective circles) match exactly.\\n  - Extrusion depth and operation match.\\n  - **Correction**: The `sketch_scale` parameter for extrusion (0.6575 in JSON) is missing from the description. This is a discrepancy.\\n\\n- Conclusion: The descriptions for both parts are incomplete regarding the `sketch_scale` parameter for their respective extrusions. Therefore, the validity is 'No'.\\n</think>"
