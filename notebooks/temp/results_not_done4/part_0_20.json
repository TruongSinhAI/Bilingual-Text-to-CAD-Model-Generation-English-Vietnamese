Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch** On the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system, draw a 2D sketch consisting of two faces: * Face 1: + Loop 1: - Circle 1: Draw a circle with a center at [0.375, 0.375] and a radius of 0.375. + Loop 2: - Circle 1: Draw a circle with a center at [0.375, 0.375] and a radius of 0.1988. **Step 3: Scale the 2D Sketch** Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter sketch\\\\_scale = 0.75. **Step 4: Transform the Scaled 2D Sketch into 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 5: Extrude the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction with an extrusion depth of 0.45 units. The height of the final part will be 0.45 units, and the width and length will be 0.75 units each, as inferred from the sketch scale. **Step 6: Determine the Boolean Operation** The boolean operation for this part is \"NewBodyFeatureOperation,\" which means it results in the creation of a new solid body. The shape of the part is a cylindrical object with a central hole, resembling a tube or pipe. The height is 0.45 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the length is 0.75 units. Now you can proceed with instructing the junior CAD designer on the next parts following the same format. Remember to state the shape, describe the sketch, and provide the details about scaling, transforming, and extruding for each part, including the final shape.</description>",
