Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector obtained from the coordinate_system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to achieve the desired depth based on the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` property, which is 0.75 units. No extrusion will be performed in the opposite direction of the normal as`extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is set to 0.0.
