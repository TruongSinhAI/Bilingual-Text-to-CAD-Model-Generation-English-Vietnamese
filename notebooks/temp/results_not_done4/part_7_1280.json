    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism Construct a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a tapered top and a flat bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, while the sides are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The top and bottom faces are equidistant from the center of the prism. The sides are of equal length and are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The prism is centered on the white background. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin, with no rotation and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Next, create the 2D sketch for the bottom face of the prism, face_1, on the X-Y plane. Within face_1, create a new loop, loop_1, which consists of four straight lines. Label these lines as follows: - line_1: starting at [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.0]. - line_2: starting at [0.75, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.75]. - line_3: starting at [0.75, 0.75] and ending at [0.0, 0.75]. - line_4: starting at [0.0, 0.75] and ending at [0.0, 0.0]. After completing the 2D sketch, scale it using a factor of 0.75, the `sketch_scale` parameter. Then, convert the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by defining a transformation using the following euler angles and translation vector: - euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.1] Now, extrude the 3D sketch to obtain the 3D model for this part. Extrude it with a depth of 0.1 towards the normal, while maintaining the top face thickness of 0.1. Use the `NewBodyFeatureOperation` for the part integration. Part 2: Cylindrical Cutout Form a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The object has a smooth surface and appears to be made of a solid material. It is centered in the image and has a uniform gray color. The cylinder has dimensions, but based on the provided information, it is assumed that the cylinder has a diameter of 0.4, a height of 0.25, and it is centered at [0.175, 0.175]. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation and a translation vector of [0.175, 0.175, 0.1]. Next, create the 2D sketch, face_1, on the X-Y plane. Within this face, create a new loop, loop_1, which consists of one circle. Label this circle as follows: - circle_1: centered at [0.2, 0.2] with a radius of 0.2. After completing the 2D sketch, scale it using a factor of 0.4, the `sketch_scale` parameter. Then, convert the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by defining a transformation using the following euler angles and translation vector: - euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Now, extrude the 3D sketch to obtain the 3D model for this part. Extrude it with a depth of 0.25 towards the normal while maintaining the top and bottom face thickness of 0.1. Use the `JoinFeatureOperation` for the part integration, as it involves joining the cylindrical cutout to the prism. This way, the final 3D model will contain a cylindrical hole through the prism.</description>",
