    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A CAD model of a rectangular prism with a single, elongated, rectangular cutout on one of its faces** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1 with the euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Next, create a sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch will consist of three faces (face 1, face 2, and face 3) and three loops. Face 1: - Loop 1: Start by creating a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0]. Then create a line from point [0.75, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.402]. Follow this by creating a line from point [0.75, 0.402] to point [0.0, 0.402]. Finally, create a line from point [0.0, 0.402] to point [0.0, 0.0] to close the loop. - Loop 2: Create a circle with its center at point [0.2847, 0.201] and a radius of 0.0783. - Loop 3: Create a circle with its center at point [0.4653, 0.201] and a radius of 0.0783. Faces 2 and 3 are constructed in a similar manner. After the sketch is complete, scale it by a factor of 0.75. Then, transform the sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. The final step is to extrude the sketch along the normal direction by a distance of 0.0076 and in the opposite direction by a distance of 0. The sketch scaling factor is 0.75 and the operation is to create a new solid body. The resulting CAD model will have a length of 0.75, a width of 0.75, and a height of 0.0076 (rounded to five decimal places). The cutout on one face of the rectangular prism is created by the two circles drawn in loops 2 and 3 of face 1. The first circle has a center at point [0.2847, 0.201] and a radius of 0.0783, and the second circle has a center at point [0.4653, 0.201] and also a radius of 0.0783. The remainder of the rectangular prism is constructed by the lines in loop 1 of face 1. The lines form a rectangle with a length of 0.75 and a width of 0.402. With the given instructions, a junior CAD designer should be able to generate an accurate CAD model of part 1.</description>",
