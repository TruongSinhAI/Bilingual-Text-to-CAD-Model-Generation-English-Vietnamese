    "prompt": "<description>**Instructions for Part 1:** Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. The height of the cylinder is approximately three times its diameter. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1 at (0.069, 0.45, 0.069) with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0). Next, start drawing the 2D sketch for part 1 on the XY plane. The sketch for part 1 consists of two loops, each containing a single circle. 1. Loop 1: Draw a circle with a center at (0.306, 0.306) and a radius of 0.306. 2. Loop 2: Draw a circle with a center at (0.306, 0.306) and a radius of 0.1418. Use a scaling parameter of 0.612 to scale the sketch. Then, extrude the sketch along the Z-axis to generate the 3D model with a depth of 0.45 units, resulting in a NewBodyFeatureOperation. The dimensions of part 1 are approximately 0.612 units in length, 0.45 units in width, and 0.612 units in height. **Instructions for Part 2:** Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a central hole. The height of the cylinder is twice its diameter. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 2 at (0.0, 0.45, 0.0) with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0). Next, start drawing the 2D sketch for part 2 on the XY plane. The sketch for part 2 consists of two loops, each containing a single circle. 1. Loop 1: Draw a circle with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. 2. Loop 2: Draw a circle with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.306. Use a scaling parameter of 0.75 to scale the sketch. Then, extrude the sketch along the Z-axis to generate the 3D model with a depth of 0.15 units, resulting in a JoinFeatureOperation. The dimensions of part 2 are approximately 0.75 units in length, 0.15 units in width, and 0.75 units in height. **Instructions for Part 3:** Construct a 3D model of a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top, resembling a stylized ring or a simplified representation of a donut. Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 3 at (0.15, 0.0, 0.15) with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0). Next, start drawing the 2D sketch for part 3 on the XY plane. The sketch for part 3 consists of two loops, each containing a single circle. 1. Loop 1: Draw a circle with a center at (0.225, 0.225) and a radius of 0.225. 2. Loop 2: Draw a circle with a center at (0.225, 0.225) and a radius of 0.1418. Use a scaling parameter of 0.45 to scale the sketch. Then, extrude the sketch along the Z-axis to generate the 3D model, but instead of moving in the positive Z direction, move in the negative Z direction with a depth of 0.0225 units. This will result in a CutFeatureOperation that removes this material from the previous part. The dimensions of part 3 are approximately 0.45 units in length, 0.0225 units in width, and 0.45 units in height. These instructions should result in the final desired shape, which is a cylindrical object with a central hole, resembling a washer or a ring. It has a flat top and bottom, and its sides are slightly curved. The object is symmetrical and appears to be made of a solid material.</description>",
