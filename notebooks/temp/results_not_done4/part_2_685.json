Step 6: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0, and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Step 7: Extrude the 3D sketch Extrude the 3D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.3125 units to create the final shape. After completing these steps, you will have completed the construction of the rectangular prism with a tapered middle section according to the specifications provided in the JSON data.
