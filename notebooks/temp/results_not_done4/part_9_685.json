Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.0008 units in the positive normal direction and 0 units in the opposite normal direction. 4. Apply the given sketch scale factor and use the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" operation for this part. After completing these steps, you'll have a three-dimensional, triangular shape with a pointed tip as your CAD model. The length, width, and height of this part are given as 0.75 units. Now you can proceed with the next parts if there are any. Confidence: 97%</description>",
