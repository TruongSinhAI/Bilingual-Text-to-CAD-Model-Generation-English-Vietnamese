For the extrusion, set the depth towards the normal to 0.173, the depth opposite the normal to 0.0, and the sketch scale to 0.3362. This will join the previous solid body with the new solid body created. The length of this part is approximately 0.3362 units, the width is also approximately 0.3362 units, and the height is 0.173 units. The final CAD model consists of these two parts, with the cylindrical object attached to the rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The length of the overall model is the sum of the lengths of the individual parts, the width is the width of the individual parts, and the height is the height of the individual parts.</description>",
