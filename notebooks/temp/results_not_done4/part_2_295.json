The rectangular base of \"part 1\" and the flat bottom of \"part 2\" form the base of the final shape. The tapered top of \"part 2\" connects to the triangular top of \"part 1\" to complete the shape. The cylindrical object is slightly tilted to the right due to the Euler angles and Translation Vector provided in \"part 2.\" The dimensions of both parts are as follows: * Part 1: length - 0.75; width - 0.75; height - 0.2537 * Part 2: length - 0.6089; width - 0.6089; height - 0.1269 Combined, the final shape has the following dimensions: length - 0.75 (approx.); width - 0.75 (approx.); height - 0.3806 (approx.).</description>",
