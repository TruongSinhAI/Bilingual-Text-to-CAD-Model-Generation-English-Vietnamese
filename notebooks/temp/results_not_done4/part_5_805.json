    "reasoning": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism The object to be constructed is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The front face is the only one that is not parallel to the top or bottom faces. The dimensions of the front face are approximately 2:3 in height to width ratio. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other and are the same size. The sides of the prism are straight and perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The object is centered in the coordinate system. 1. Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.45, 0.0] 2.
