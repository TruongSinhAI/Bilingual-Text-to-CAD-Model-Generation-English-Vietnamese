However, the JSON's `sketch_scale` for part 2's extrusion is `0.1351`, which is consistent with the initial sketch scaling mentioned in the description (\"\n    ,\"Scale the sketch using a scaling factor of 0.1351\"\n    ,\"). The \"\n    ,\"sketch_scale of 1\"\n    ,\" in the extrusion step of the description is an inconsistency.\\n\\nCorrection: The description contains an incorrect `sketch_scale` value (1) in the extrusion properties for Part 2, which contradicts the JSON's `sketch_scale` (0.1351). This makes the description not perfectly match the JSON.\"\n    ,\"</think>"
