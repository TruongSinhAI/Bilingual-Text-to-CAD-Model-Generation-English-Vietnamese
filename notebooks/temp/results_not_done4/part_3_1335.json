The operation \"  ,  \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"  ,  \" is appropriate for the first part.\\n\\n-Correction: The conflicting transformation parameters in the description regarding the 3D transform of the sketch (Euler Angles and Translation Vector) result in a mismatch with the single, consistent coordinate system defined in the JSON.
