    "prompt": "<description>**Instructions for creating the first part** **Shape being constructed:** A CAD model of a rectangular prism with a smaller rectangular prism attached to its side. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation and no translation. Next, create a face for the first part. On this face, draw the first loop. The first loop consists of nine straight lines. They are: * The first line goes from (0, 0) to (0.1688, 0). * The second line goes from (0.1688, 0) to (0.1688, 0.0938). * The third line goes from (0.1688, 0.0938) to (0.1688, 0.3562). * The fourth line goes from (0.1688, 0.3562) to (0.1688, 0.45). * The fifth line goes from (0.1688, 0.45) to (0.0, 0.45). * The sixth line goes from (0.0, 0.45) to (0.0, 0.3). * The seventh line goes from (0.0, 0.3) to (0.1219, 0.3). * The eighth line goes from (0.1219, 0.3) to (0.1219, 0.15). * The ninth line goes from (0.1219, 0.15) to (0.0, 0.15). * The tenth line goes from (0.0, 0.15) to (0.0, 0.0). The loop is closed, meaning the start and end points of the lines connect. Create a second face for the first part. On this face, draw the second loop. The second loop also consists of nine straight lines. They are: * The first line goes from (0.5812, 0.0) to (0.5812, 0.0938). * The second line goes from (0.5812, 0.0938) to (0.5812, 0.3562). * The third line goes from (0.5812, 0.3562) to (0.5812, 0.45). * The fourth line goes from (0.5812, 0.45) to (0.75, 0.45). * The fifth line goes from (0.75, 0.45) to (0.75, 0.3). * The sixth line goes from (0.75, 0.3) to (0.6281, 0.3). * The seventh line goes from (0.6281, 0.3) to (0.6281, 0.15). * The eighth line goes from (0.6281, 0.15) to (0.75, 0.15). * The ninth line goes from (0.75, 0.15) to (0.75, 0.0). * The tenth line goes from (0.75, 0.0) to (0.5812, 0.0). Again, the loop is closed, meaning the start and end points of the lines connect. After creating the sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrude depth towards the normal is 0.0938 and the extrude depth opposite the normal is 0. This completes the instructions for creating the first part of the CAD model.</description>",

The base will be the first sketch, and the second sketch will be used to create the tapered walls. **Sketch 1: Base of the Cylindrical Object** 1. Create a new coordinate system with the given euler angles (-90°, 0°, 0°) and translation vector (0.1657, 0.4144, 0). 2. Draw a rectangle on the XY plane using the two points: (0, 0.2072) and (0.0829, 0.4102). This rectangle will be the base of the cylindrical object. 3. Draw a circle centered at (0.0414, 0) with a radius of 0.0414. This circle will connect the two corners of the rectangle, creating a smooth base for the cylindrical object. 4. Close the loop by connecting the endpoints of the circle and line segments. This will form a closed loop with four line segments and one circle. 5. Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.4144 units, producing a cylindrical shape with a flat base. **Sketch 2: Tapered Walls of the Cylindrical Object** 1. Draw a rectangle on the XY plane using the same two points as before: (0, 0.2072) and (0.0829, 0.4102). This rectangle should be a mirror image of the first one. 2. Draw an arc centered at (0.0414, 0.4144) with a radius of 0.0414, connecting the two endpoints of the rectangle. This arc will create the tapered top of the cylindrical object. 3. Close the loop by connecting the endpoints of the arc and line segments. This will form a closed loop with four line segments and one arc. 4. Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.4144 units and scale it by 0.4144 to create a tapered cylindrical object. The resulting object will be a solid, three-dimensional cylindrical shape with a slightly tapered top and bottom, as described in the final shape description. The dimensions of this part should be approximately 0.4144 units for length, width, and height. The next parts should be constructed using similar methods, building upon the previous parts as specified in the CAD Assembly JSON.</description>",
