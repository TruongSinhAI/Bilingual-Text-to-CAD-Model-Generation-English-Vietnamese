The prism is centered on a white background, and the top edge of the prism is slightly curved, creating a smooth transition from the top to the bottom of the prism. The prism is the only object in the image. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the following location and orientation: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0236, 0.0] Now, create the 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch consists of 1 face, which is further divided into multiple lines and arcs, forming several loops, including: * Loop 1: + Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.225, 0.0] + Arc 1: Start Point [0.225, 0.0], Mid Point [0.2712, 0.0278], End Point [0.3242, 0.0375] + Line 2: Start Point [0.3242, 0.0375], End Point [0.375, 0.0375] + Line 3: Start Point [0.375, 0.0375], End Point [0.4258, 0.0375] + Arc 2: Start Point [0.4258, 0.0375], Mid Point [0.4788, 0.0278], End Point [0.525, 0.0] + Line 4: Start Point [0.525, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] + Line 5: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.1126] + Line 6: Start Point [0.75, 0.1126], End Point [0.525, 0.1126] + Arc 3: Start Point [0.525, 0.1126], Mid Point [0.4788, 0.0847], End Point [0.4258, 0.0751] + Line 7: Start Point [0.4258, 0.0751], End Point [0.375, 0.0751] + Line 8: Start Point [0.375, 0.0751], End Point [0.3242, 0.0751] + Arc 4: Start Point [0.3242, 0.0751], Mid Point [0.2712, 0.0847], End Point [0.225, 0.1126] + Line 9: Start Point [0.225, 0.1126], End Point [0.0, 0.1126] + Line 10: Start Point [0.0, 0.1126], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This completes the 2D sketch for Part 1. Next, scale the sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system. Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal direction to create the 3D solid with the given extrusion depth: * Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.0118 * Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0118 Apply the \"Add Material\" operation to complete the construction of Part 1, a rectangular prism with a curved top edge.
