Sketching the Base Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin (0, 0, 0) with no rotation. Create the base of the prism by drawing a series of lines and arcs on the X-Y plane as follows: 1. Draw the first line from (0, 0.3395) to (0.0465, 0.2982). 2. Draw the second line from (0.0465, 0.2982) to (0.586, 0.3841). 3. Draw the third line from (0.586, 0.3841) to (0.5905, 0.4177). 4. Draw the fourth line from (0.5905, 0.4177) to (0.0414, 0.373). 5. Close the loop by drawing the fifth line from (0.0414, 0.373) to (0.0, 0.3395). Now, create the second loop using these lines to form the base of the prism: * Line 1: From (0.0414, 0.373) to (0.5905, 0.4177) * Line 2: From (0.5905, 0.4177) to (0.5969, 0.4668) * Line 3: From (0.5969, 0.4668) to (0.1821, 0.4872) * Line 4: From (0.1821, 0.4872) to (0.0414, 0.373) Create the third loop by drawing lines along the edges of the prism's base and a triangle in the middle: * Line 1: From (0.0465, 0.2982) to (0.1215, 0.2314) * Line 2: From (0.1215, 0.2314) to (0.2598, 0.1085) * Line 3: From (0.2598, 0.1085) to (0.5579, 0.1706) * Line 4: From (0.5579, 0.1706) to (0.567, 0.2397) * Line 5: From (0.567, 0.2397) to (0.586, 0.3841) * Line 6: From (0.586, 0.3841) to (0.0465, 0.2982) Create the remaining loops, as specified in the JSON data, to form the base of the prism. Scaling and Extruding the Sketch Now that you have the base of the prism, scale it by 0.75 and extrude it by 0.1421 units along the Z-axis. This will create a 3D prism with a flat top and bottom.
