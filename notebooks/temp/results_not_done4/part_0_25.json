The euler angles are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.2727, 0.0]. Next, we will create the 2D sketch for this part. The sketch is drawn on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch for this part contains a single face (face\\\\_1). Face\\\\_1 contains a single loop (loop\\\\_1) which is made up of the following curves: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.4091] * Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.4091], End Point [0.0, 0.4091] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.4091], End Point [0.0, 0.0] After creating the 2D sketch, we will scale it using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter, which has a value of 0.75. Next, we will transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, we will extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.2727 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0.0. The sketch scale is 0.75. The operation for this part is to create a new solid body. The height of this part is 0.4091, the width is 0.2727, and the length is 0.75. **Part 2: Constructing a Rectangular Prism with Rounded Corners** We will now construct the second part of the assembly. Similar to the first part, we will start by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: Coordinate System: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.2727, 0.0] Next, we will create the 2D sketch for this part.

The final shape is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. The height of the final shape is 6 units, the width is 4 units, and the length is 2 units.</description>",
