We will begin by creating a new coordinate system, followed by creating a 2D sketch, extruding it into a 3D model, and finally, providing a description of the part. 1. **Create a new coordinate system** For part 1, we need to create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.015, 0.0) 2. **Draw a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system** Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. We need to draw several lines to form a rectangle and taper the top and bottom. The sketch will consist of four lines. - **Line 1**: Draw a line starting at point (0.0, 0.0) and ending at point (0.6, 0.0) - **Line 2**: Draw a line starting at point (0.6, 0.0) and ending at point (0.6, 0.75) - **Line 3**: Draw a line starting at point (0.6, 0.75) and ending at point (0.0, 0.75) - **Line 4**: Draw a line starting at point (0.0, 0.75) and ending at point (0.0, 0.0) 3. **Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch** Since our coordinate system has non-zero Euler angles, we first need to rotate the sketch and then translate it. The point (0.0, 0.0) on the original XY plane will be the reference point for rotation and translation. 4. **Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the 2D sketch along its normal vector by a depth of 0.015 units. This action will create a 3D solid model with dimensions 0.75 (length) x 0.015 (width) x 0.75 (height). 5. **Description** Specify the following information for part 1: * Shape: A rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.015 * Height: 0.75 With these instructions, the first part of the CAD assembly should be successfully constructed.</description>",
