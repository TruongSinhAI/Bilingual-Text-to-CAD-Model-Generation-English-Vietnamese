The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. 1. *Create a new coordinate system.* Set the Euler angles as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees and the translation vector as [0.0, 0.0, 0.2182] units. Sketching 1.1. Draw the 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. 1.2. For the `face_1` of the prism, create a loop named `loop_1`. A loop is always closed. 1.3. Define four lines: a. `line_1` is from the point (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0). b. `line_2` is from the point (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.4773). c. `line_3` is from the point (0.75, 0.4773) to (0.0, 0.4773). d. `line_4` is from the point (0.0, 0.4773) to (0.0, 0.0). Extrusion 1. Scale the 2D sketch using `sketch_scale` = 0.75. 2. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the provided euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.2182]. 3. Extrude the 3D model from the 2D sketch by providing a depth value of 0.1091 units along the normal direction and an opposite direction depth of 0.1091 units. This operation adds material. The final height of the prism is 0.2182 units. The length and width are both 0.75 units. **Remember to follow these instructions for each part of the CAD assembly to create the final shape.**</description>",
