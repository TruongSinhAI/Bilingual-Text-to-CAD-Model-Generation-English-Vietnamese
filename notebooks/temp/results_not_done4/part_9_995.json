Operation \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" is inferred as it's the second part and standard practice is to join subsequent parts.\\n--Result: Extrusion parameters are consistent.\\n\\n-Correction: The inferred data matches the JSON precisely, with the understanding that arc radius in the description is a geometric property, not a direct JSON field for arcs using start/mid/end points.
