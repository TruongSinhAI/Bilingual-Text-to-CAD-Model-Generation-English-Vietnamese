    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Metal Bar with Three Holes Step 1: Create Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation or translation. Step 2: Draw Sketch for Metal Bar Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (face 1) of the coordinate system. Step 3: Draw Curves for Metal Bar * Draw line 1 from point (0.075, 0) to point (0.75, 0). * Draw line 2 from point (0.75, 0) to point (0.75, 0.15). * Draw line 3 from point (0.75, 0.15) to point (0.075, 0.15). * Draw arc 1 from point (0.075, 0.15) to point (0.075, 0) with a center at point (0, 0.075). Step 4: Create Loops for Metal Bar * Loop 1 contains line 1, line 2, line 3, and arc 1, closing the loop. Step 5: Create Faces for Metal Bar * Face 1 consists of loop 1, forming a flat, rectangular shape. Step 6: Scale Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Step 7: Extrude Sketch into 3D Shape Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by a distance of 0.025 units. This creates a rectangular metal bar with a height of 0.025 units. Step 8: Create Holes Along Length On the same sketch plane, create three circles centered at points (0.075, 0.075), (0.375, 0.075), and (0.675, 0.075) with a radius of 0.025 units each. These circles will represent the holes along the length of the metal bar. Ensure these circles are created as part of the same sketch for later use. Step 9: Extrude Holes Extrude the three circles along the Z-axis, creating three holes through the metal bar. Note that the holes will not have a uniform height, as the sketch was scaled before extrusion. The height of the holes will match the height of the metal bar at 0.025 units. For the final shape: The metal bar has the following dimensions: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.025 units The holes have a consistent diameter of 0.05 units and a height of 0.025 units, matching the height of the metal bar.</description>",
