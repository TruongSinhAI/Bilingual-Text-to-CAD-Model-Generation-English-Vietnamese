This line closes the loop. Note that this face contains a single loop with 8 line segments. Next, we need to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. Apply the following transformation: * Rotate the sketch around the X, Y, and Z axes by the Euler Angles specified in the coordinate system (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) degrees. * Translate the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0097 meters. After transforming the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch, we need to extrude it to create the 3D prism. Perform the extrusion with the following parameters: * Extrude depth towards the normal: 0.0049 meters * Extrude depth opposite the normal: 0.0049 meters * Use the sketch scale factor: 0.75 This will create the first part with the provided shape and dimensions.</description>",
