Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.1836. Extrude the sketch along its normal direction by 0.1147 units, resulting in a final height of 0.1147 units. Use the \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" option for this part's boolean operation. Construct a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom and a curved side. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with an euler angle of [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0459, 0.3083].
