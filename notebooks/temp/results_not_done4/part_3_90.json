    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Long, Thin, Rectangular Prism with a Slightly Tapered End Start by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles are 0, 0, 0 and the translation vector is [0.0066, 0.0102, 0.0795]. Now, move on to creating the 2D sketch. On face 1, create loop 1 as follows: * Line 1: Starting point [0.0, 0.023], ending point [0.0133, 0.0]. * Line 2: Starting point [0.0133, 0.0], ending point [0.0398, 0.0]. * Line 3: Starting point [0.0398, 0.0], ending point [0.053, 0.023]. * Line 4: Starting point [0.053, 0.023], ending point [0.0398, 0.0459]. * Line 5: Starting point [0.0398, 0.0459], ending point [0.0133, 0.0459]. * Line 6: Starting point [0.0133, 0.0459], ending point [0.0, 0.023]. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.053. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D sketch using euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch, creating a 3D model with a depth of 0.6175 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal, according to the provided \"extrusion\" parameters. Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Tapered Top Just like before, begin by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles are 0, 0, 0 and the translation vector is [0.0106, 0.0106, 0.697]. Proceed to create the 2D sketch for this part. Focus on face 1 and make loop 1 as follows: * Circle 1: Center at [0.0225, 0.0225], with a radius of 0.0225. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.0451. Convert the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector of the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch, building a 3D model with a depth of 0.053 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal, as per the \"extrusion\" parameters. Good job! You've just followed instructions from a CAD Assembly JSON to generate parametric CAD models for two parts as per the final shape. Use these methods to build the entire assembly based on the provided JSON data and continue creating new parts assembling them together with the proper boolean operations.</description>",
