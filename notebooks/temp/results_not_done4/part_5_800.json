    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Construct a rectangular metal bracket with two holes on the top side** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.05, 0.0] **Sketch 1:** Create the first sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. Draw the following shapes in sequence: 1. Draw a line from point (0.075, 0.0) to point (0.675, 0.0) 2. Draw an arc with center (0.75, 0.075), starting point (0.675, 0.0), ending point (0.675, 0.15), and a counter-clockwise direction. 3. Draw a line from point (0.675, 0.15) to point (0.075, 0.15) 4. Draw an arc with center (0.0, 0.075), starting point (0.075, 0.15), ending point (0.075, 0.0), and a clockwise direction. Now, you should have a rectangular shape with two curved corners on the top. **Sketch 2:** Create a new closed loop on the same sketch plane with the following shape: 1. Draw a circle with center (0.075, 0.075) and radius 0.025. This will create the first hole. **Sketch 3:** Create another closed loop on the same sketch plane with the following shape: 1. Draw a line from point (0.175, 0.0375) to point (0.575, 0.0375) 2. Draw an arc with center (0.6125, 0.075), starting point (0.575, 0.0375) ending point (0.575, 0.1125), and a counter-clockwise direction. 3. Draw a line from point (0.575, 0.1125) to point (0.175, 0.1125) 4. Draw an arc with center (0.1375, 0.075), starting point (0.175, 0.1125), ending point (0.175, 0.0375), and a clockwise direction. Now, you should have a second hole on the top side of the rectangle. **Extrusion:** Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.05 units. Then scale the resulting 3D solid by 0.75 in all directions. This will form the final 3D rectangular metal bracket with two holes on the top side. Make sure to set the \"operation\" property as \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" to create a new solid body in the CAD model. The final dimensions should be as follows: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.05 * Height: 0.75</description>",
