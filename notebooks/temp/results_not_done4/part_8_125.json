    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** The first part of the CAD assembly is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height. **Step 1: Draw a 2D Sketch** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0, 0, 0, and translation vector of 0, 0, 0. Begin by sketching on the XY plane. **Step 2: Sketch a Hexagon on the XY Plane** Construct a hexagon on the XY plane using the following lines: 1. Line 1: Start Point (0, 0.1877), End Point (0.124, 0) 2. Line 2: Start Point (0.124, 0), End Point (0.3486, 0.0135) 3. Line 3: Start Point (0.3486, 0.0135), End Point (0.4492, 0.2148) 4.

Line 6: Start Point (0.1006, 0.389), End Point (0, 0.1877) **Step 3: Scale and Transform the Sketch into a 3D Model** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.4492. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D by applying the following euler angles: 0, 0, 0, and translation vector: 0, 0, 0. Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.75 units towards the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction of the normal. This will result in a final height of the prism equal to 1 unit. At this point, you have completed generating the first part of the CAD assembly, a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Move on to generating the subsequent parts, following the same process outlined above until you have completed the entire CAD assembly.</description>",
