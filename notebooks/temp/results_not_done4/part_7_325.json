Extrude the sketch with a depth of 0.075 towards the normal and 0.075 in the opposite direction, and scale the sketch by a factor of 0.225. Part 2 Construct a rectangular metal bracket with two holes on opposite sides. Start by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles (0, 0, 0) and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0.15). For the sketch, construct face 1: - Loop 1: - Line 1: Start Point (0.0119, 0), End Point (0.3128, 0) - Arc 1: Start Point (0.3128, 0), Mid Point (0.2625, 0.0938), End Point (0.3128, 0.1875) - Line 2: Start Point (0.3128, 0.1875), End Point (0.0119, 0.1875) - Arc 2: Start Point (0.0119, 0.1875), Mid Point (0, 0.0938), End Point (0.0119, 0) Loop 1 forms the outer rectangle of the bracket. For Loop 2 in Face 1, create a circle with Center (0.105, 0.0937) and Radius (0.0365). This forms a hole in the bracket. Construct face 2 and face 3 by duplicating face 1 with different holes. Make sure the faces share edges and vertices. Extrude the sketches of each face by 0.075 in the opposite direction of the normal. The height of part 1 is 0.15, and the height of part 2 is 0.075. The final shape has a height of 1.25. The width and length of part 1 are both 0.225. The width of the rectangular opening is approximately 0.5, and the length of part 1 is also approximately 0.5. The width and length of part 2 are 0.75. The distances between the two holes in the bracket are approximately 0.25 and 0.45, respectively. The final shape has dimensions of approximately 4 x 2 x 1.25. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of about 0.5 units.</description>",

The Euler angles [-90.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.245, 0.0408] are correctly specified.\\n    *   Sketch: `face_1` contains two loops, `loop_1` and `loop_2`.\\n        *   `loop_1` defines the outer rectangular boundary. The start and end points for all four lines (line 1 to line 4) are consistent with the JSON, forming a closed loop.\\n        *   `loop_2` defines the inner rectangular cut-out, creating the hollow center. The start and end points for all four lines (line 1 to line 4) are consistent with the JSON, forming a closed inner loop. The presence of two closed loops within a single face implies a hollow extrusion, which matches the description \\\"Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Hollow Center\\\".\\n    *   Extrusion: The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.245), `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0), and `sketch_scale` (0.75) all match the JSON. The `operation` is correctly inferred as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" from \\\"Create a new solid body\\\".\\n\\n*   **Overall Consistency:** The description accurately and comprehensively matches the JSON structure for Part 1. All geometric details, coordinate system properties, and extrusion parameters are consistent. No corrections are necessary.\\n</think>"
