The height of the part is 1.0928, the width is 0.6557, and the length is 0.6557. Part 2: Three-Dimensional, Rectangular Prism with Tapered Top and Bottom Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system.

The height of the part is 0.2186, the width is 0.75, and the length is 0.75. Note: The final shape is not explicitly provided by the JSON data. Based on the given parts, the final shape is inferred to be a combination of Part 1 and Part 2, resulting in a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, as described in the introduction. The height, width, and length of the final shape cannot be easily determined as the final shape is a result of the boolean operations between Part 1 and Part 2, and it is not explicitly given.</description>",
