The sketch does not contain any arcs or circles. Now, scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter (sketch_scale) 0.75. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.0937 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0.0. The final shape is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and a flat bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The model is centered and has a uniform gray color. The length is approximately 0.75, the width is 0.0937, and the height is approximately 0.75.</description>",
