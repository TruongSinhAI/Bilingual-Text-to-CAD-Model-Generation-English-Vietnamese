The front and back faces are parallel to each other, while the side faces are perpendicular to the front and back faces. The object is centered in the image. **Step 1: Draw a 2D Sketch** Begin with a new coordinate system, having euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Draw a single face (face_1) on the XY plane. Within face_1, create a loop (loop_1) using the following lines: 1. line_1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] 2. line_2: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.4956] 3. line_3: [0.75, 0.4956] to [0.5357, 0.4956] 4. line_4: [0.5357, 0.4956] to [0.5357, 0.335] 5. line_5: [0.5357, 0.335] to [0.2143, 0.335] 6. line_6: [0.2143, 0.335] to [0.2143, 0.4956] 7. line_7: [0.2143, 0.4956] to [0.0, 0.4956] 8. line_8: [0.0, 0.4956] to [0.0, 0.0] The loop is closed, as line_8 connects the start and end points of loop_1. **Step 2: Scale the 2D Sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. **Step 3: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using a rotation of 0.0 degrees around the X, Y, and Z axes, and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.482 units (extrude_depth_towards_normal) to create the 3D model. This completes the instructions for the first intermediate CAD part, which is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with the following dimensions: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.482 units</description>",
