Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the following transformation: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following properties: - Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.4 - Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 - Sketch Scale: 0.2 - Operation: Join the current part with the previous body.
