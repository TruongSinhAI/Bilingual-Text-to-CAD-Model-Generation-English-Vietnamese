    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one of its faces** The first part of the CAD assembly is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one of its faces. This part is the base part upon which subsequent parts will be constructed. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] Next, create the 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch will have one face (face\\\\_1) that contains one loop (loop\\\\_1). Loop\\\\_1 will have seven lines (line\\\\_1 to line\\\\_7) as follows: 1. line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.0, 0.375] 2. line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.0, 0.375], End Point = [0.0, 0.75] 3. line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.0, 0.75], End Point = [0.375, 0.75] 4. line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.375, 0.75], End Point = [0.375, 0.375] 5. line\\\\_5: Start Point = [0.375, 0.375], End Point = [0.75, 0.375] 6. line\\\\_6: Start Point = [0.75, 0.375], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] 7. line\\\\_7: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] The 2D sketch will appear as a rectangle with a triangular cutout on the top. Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter `sketch_scale` that is set to 0.75 in the assembly JSON. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector specified by the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The depth of the extrusion towards the normal is 0.75 units, and the depth of the extrusion in the opposite direction of the normal is 0.0 units. Note that `operation` is set to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", which means that this part will be the base part for the subsequent parts. The dimensions of this part are as follows: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.75 Next, create the subsequent parts by building upon this base part according to the instructions provided in the assembly JSON. Remember to create a new coordinate system for each part, draw a 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system, scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter `sketch_scale`, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector specified by the coordinate system, and extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Also, remember to adjust the depths of the extrusion towards the normal and in the opposite direction of the normal, and the boolean operation for each part as specified in the assembly JSON.</description>",
