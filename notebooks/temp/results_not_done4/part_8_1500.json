The coordinates match the JSON.\\n  - Loop 2 (inner rectangle): The lines also connect sequentially ([0.0536, 0.0536] -> [0.4821, 0.0536] -> [0.4821, 0.6964] -> [0.0536, 0.6964] -> [0.0536, 0.0536]), forming a closed rectangle. The coordinates match the JSON.\\n  - The presence of two loops, one nested inside the other, correctly indicates a hollow rectangular profile, which is consistent with the \"\n    ,\"rectangular prism\"\n    ,\" description with implicitly a hole.\\n\\n- Extrusion Properties:\\n  - `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0536) and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0536) values match the JSON. This indicates a total extrusion depth of 0.1072, centered around the sketch plane.\\n  - `sketch_scale` (0.75) matches the JSON.\\n  - `operation` (`NewBodyFeatureOperation`) is a correct inference for creating this new primary body.\\n\\n- Overall Consistency:\\n  - The description provides all necessary details to accurately reconstruct the JSON structure and its values. All numerical data, geometric definitions, and operational parameters are consistent between the description and the JSON.\\n\\n- Correction: No corrections are necessary. The inferred data is accurate and complete, matching the provided JSON.\\n</think>"
