The height, width, and length of this part are 0.1257 meters, 0.375 meters, and 0.1257 meters, respectively. **Step 1: Draw a 2D Sketch on a Plane Defined by the Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the given Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) and the translation vector (0.0, 0.375, 0.0). On this coordinate system, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. **Step 2: Scale the 2D Sketch Using the Scaling Parameter** Scale the drawn 2D sketch by a factor of 0.1257. **Step 3: Transform the Scale 2D Sketch into 3D Sketch** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles and translation vector. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal and opposite normal directions by 0.1875 meters each, resulting in the creation of a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.
