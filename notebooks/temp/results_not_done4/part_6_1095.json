    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A rectangular prism with a tapered top and bottom, and a cylindrical hole through its center Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will serve as the base for our first CAD part. Sketch Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 1. Draw the first line, starting at [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Draw the second line, starting at [0.75, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.0469]. 3. Draw the third line, starting at [0.75, 0.0469] and ending at [0.0, 0.0469]. 4. Draw the fourth line, starting at [0.0, 0.0469] and ending at [0.0, 0.0]. Extrusion Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.1406 towards the normal and 0.0 in the opposite direction. Apply sketch scaling of 0.75. The result is a 3D prism with a tapered top and bottom and a height of 0.1406. Part 2: A series of rectangular prisms aligned in a straight line Create a new coordinate system based on the previous part, but with a translation vector of [0.0938, 0.0, 0.1406]. Sketch Draw multiple sketches on different planes of the coordinate system: 1. Sketch 1: Create a rectangle similar to Part 1's sketch using line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4. 2. Sketch 2: Create a smaller rectangle by shifting the start point of each line from Sketch 1. 3. Sketch 3: Create another rectangle, smaller than the previous one by further shifting the start points of each line. 4. Sketch 4: Create a final rectangle, even smaller than the previous one, similarly shifting the start points. Extrusion Extrude each sketch equally in the positive Z direction by 0.0469, creating a series of rectangular prisms. Apply sketch scaling of 0.6562. The result is a line of rectangular prisms with varying heights and widths. Final Shape Combine Part 1 and Part 2 following these guidelines: 1. For Part 1, identify any area where it intersects with Part 2. If necessary, cut or trim materials based on the intersection, ensuring a clean fit between both parts. 2. For Part 2, introduce an additional sketch on a new plane within the coordinate system of Part 1. This new sketch should feature a cylindrical shape with specified dimensions. 3. Extrude the cylindrical sketch on Part 2's existing Z-depth with a cut operation, effectively creating a cylindrical hole through the center of the rectangular prism (Part 1). The scale should remain the same as Part 2's initial extrusion. The resulting shape will be the desired rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center.</description>",
