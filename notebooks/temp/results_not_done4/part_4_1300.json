This matches the JSON structure.\\\\n    -   Verify line connectivity for `loop_1`:\\\\n        -   line_1 End [0.0, 0.4407] matches line_2 Start [0.0, 0.4407].\\\\n        -   line_2 End [0.6186, 0.4407] matches line_3 Start [0.6186, 0.4407].\\\\n        -   line_3 End [0.75, 0.4407] matches line_4 Start [0.75, 0.4407].\\\\n        -   line_4 End [0.75, 0.3789] matches line_5 Start [0.75, 0.3789].\\\\n        -   line_5 End [0.6186, 0.0] matches line_6 Start [0.6186, 0.0].\\\\n        -   line_6 End [0.4324, 0.052] matches line_7 Start [0.4324, 0.052].\\\\n        -   line_7 End [0.4374, 0.1214] matches line_8 Start [0.4374, 0.1214].\\\\n        -   line_8 End [0.4021, 0.1624] matches line_9 Start [0.4021, 0.1624].\\\\n        -   line_9 End [0.0, 0.1624] matches line_1 Start [0.0, 0.1624].\\\\n    -   Result: The sketch loop is valid and closed. The coordinates for all lines are exactly as described.\\\\n-   Check extrusion:\\\\n    -   `extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0019` is correct.\\\\n    -   `extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0` is correctly inferred from \\\"along the normal direction\\\".\\\\n    -   `sketch_scale: 0.75` is correct.\\\\n    -   `operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\"` is a standard operation for creating a new part body and is consistent with the initial part creation.\\\\n\\\\n-Correction: All inferred values match the JSON and are logically consistent with the description. No corrections needed.\\\\n</think>"
