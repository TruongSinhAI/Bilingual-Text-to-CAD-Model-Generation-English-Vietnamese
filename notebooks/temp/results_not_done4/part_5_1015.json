The json has both loops under \"\n        , \"face_1\"\n        , \".-- loop_1: This loop is defined by 4 lines:--- line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0] to End Point [0.15, 0.0]--- line_2: Start Point [0.15, 0.0] to End Point [0.15, 0.3]--- line_3: Start Point [0.15, 0.3] to End Point [0.0, 0.3]--- line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.3] to End Point [0.0, 0.0]-- loop_2: This loop is defined by 4 lines:--- line_1: Start Point [0.015, 0.015] to End Point [0.135, 0.015]--- line_2: Start Point [0.135, 0.015] to End Point [0.135, 0.285]--- line_3: Start Point [0.135, 0.285] to End Point [0.015, 0.285]--- line_4: Start Point [0.015, 0.285] to End Point [0.015, 0.015]- extrusion: The extrusion properties are defined by:-- extrude_depth_towards_normal: \"\n        , \"Extrude the two loops created above by 0.75 units in the normal direction\"\n        , \" implies 0.75.-- extrude_depth_opposite_normal: \"\n        , \"in the normal direction\"\n        , \" implies no extrusion in the opposite direction, so 0.0.-- sketch_scale: \"\n        , \"Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.3.\"\n        , \" implies 0.3.-- operation: \"\n        , \"Construct the base part of the final shape\"\n        , \" suggests a \"\n        , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n        , \" as it's creating a new body.***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:- Coordinate System: The Euler Angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and Translation Vector [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] are consistent with the JSON.- Sketch - face_1 - loop_1 (Outer rectangle): The start and end points for all four lines connect correctly to form a closed rectangle. The coordinates match the JSON.- Sketch - face_1 - loop_2 (Inner rectangle): The start and end points for all four lines connect correctly to form a closed rectangle. The coordinates match the JSON. The presence of two loops under a single \"\n        , \"face_1\"\n        , \" for extrusion is standard practice for creating parts with holes or specific outlines.- Extrusion:-- extrude_depth_towards_normal: The value 0.75 matches the JSON.-- extrude_depth_opposite_normal: The inferred value 0.0 matches the JSON.-- sketch_scale: The value 0.3 matches the JSON and is explicitly stated in the description before the extrusion step.-- operation: The inferred \"\n        , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n        , \" matches the JSON.All components derived from the description accurately reflect the JSON structure and values.Correction: This inferred data is accurate and does not require further modifications.</think>"
