Face 1 consists of two loops, loop 1 and loop 2. Loop 1 contains four lines (line 1, line 2, line 3, and line 4) while loop 2 contains only one circle centered at point 0.375, 0.375 with radius 0.1875. Face 2 consists of only one loop (loop 1) which contains one circle centered at point 0.375, 0.375 with radius 0.1875. As the instructions are written in a clear and concise manner and each step is described explicitly, the junior CAD designer should be able to generate an accurate CAD model based on these instructions.</description>",
