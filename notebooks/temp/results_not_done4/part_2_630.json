    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Instructions Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions are approximately 2:1:1. Creating the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system.

Creating the Sketch On this coordinate system, create a new sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. **Face 1:** 1.

Draw the loop (loop_1) with 4 lines that are identical to the lines in Face 1, loop_1. Creating the Extrusion Extrude the sketch in the direction of the normal by 0.0236 units; maintain its depth by not extruding in the opposite direction. The sketch scale will be 0.75. This operation results in the creation of a new solid body. Part 2 Instructions Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a curved top and bottom. Creating the Coordinate System Reuse the same coordinate system as for Part 1. Creating the Sketch For Part 2, you will reuse the sketch from Part 1. Creating the Extrusion Perform an extrusion by setting extrude_depth_towards_normal to 0.2008 units, while keeping the depth at 0 for the opposite direction. Maintain a sketch scale of 0.75. This will result in a join operation with the preceding CAD models. With the provided CAD Assembly JSON, you have now constructed a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side, centered on the x-axis and slightly offset from the y-axis, with an approximate 2:1:1 dimension ratio. This includes two successive parts with an \"Approximately 3:1:1\" shape.</description>",

This forms another closed loop.\\n    *   The overall structure of the sketch with `face_1` containing `loop_1` and `loop_2`, and `face_2` containing `loop_1`, is consistent with the JSON.\\n-   Extrusion Details:\\n    *   The description states: \\\"Extrude Face 1 by 0.375 units towards the normal and Face 2 by 0.0 units opposite the normal.\\\"\\n    *   The JSON has a single extrusion block for the part's sketch: `\\\"extrude_depth_towards_normal\\\": 0.375` and `\\\"extrude_depth_opposite_normal\\\": 0.0`.\\n    *   Assuming the single extrusion block applies to all faces/loops within the sketch, the values for `extrude_depth_towards_normal` and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` directly correspond to the maximum required extrusion in each direction mentioned in the description. The sketch scale (0.4167) and operation (`NewBodyFeatureOperation`) also match. The phrasing \\\"Extrude Face 1 by X and Face 2 by Y\\\" might typically imply separate extrusion commands or modifiers per face, but in the context of a single extrusion block in JSON, it is most likely specifying the overall extrusion parameters that apply to the combined sketch profile(s). The specific values match, so it's considered consistent.\\n\\n-Correction: This inferred data is accurate and does not require further modifications.\\n</think>"
