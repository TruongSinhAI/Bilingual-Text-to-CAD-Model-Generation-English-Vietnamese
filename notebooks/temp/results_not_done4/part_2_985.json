For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and add two loops (loop\\\\_1 and loop\\\\_2) as follows: - Loop 1: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0033] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0033], End Point [0.75, 0.5658] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.5658], End Point [0.0, 0.5658] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.5658], End Point [0.0, 0.0] - Loop 2: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0937, 0.0501], End Point [0.6562, 0.0501] - Line 2: Start Point [0.6562, 0.0501], End Point [0.6562, 0.5189] - Line 3: Start Point [0.6562, 0.5189], End Point [0.0937, 0.5189] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0937, 0.5189], End Point [0.0937, 0.0501] Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.42 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. This will create a three-dimensional geometric shape with a hollow center, as described. **Part 2: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Slightly Tapered Top and Bottom** Create a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0937, 0.0501]. For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and add one loop (loop\\\\_1) as follows: - Loop 1: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.5625, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.5625, 0.0], End Point [0.5625, 0.4687] - Line 3: Start Point [0.5625, 0.4687], End Point [0.0, 0.4687] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.4687], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.5625. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.1875 units and no extrusion in the opposite direction. This will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom, as described. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners. This is achieved by combining the two intermediate parts using the appropriate boolean operations (NewBodyFeatureOperation and JoinFeatureOperation) during the extrusion process.</description>",
