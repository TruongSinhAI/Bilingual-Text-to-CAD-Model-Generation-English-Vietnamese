However, the JSON for `part_1` has a Translation Vector of `[0.0, 0.0099, 0.0]`. This is a significant discrepancy. Euler Angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] match.-**Sketch Geometry**: The four lines defining `loop_1` of `face_1` in the description correctly form a closed rectangle. The coordinates match the JSON.-**Extrusion Parameters**: `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.75) and `sketch_scale` (0.0025) match the JSON. `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is correctly 0. `operation` is correctly inferred as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\".-**Missing Components**: The most significant issue is that the description details the creation of a \\\"cylindrical hole\\\" with associated sketch components (face_2, two circles) and an operation (Thicken tool). These components are entirely absent from the provided JSON, which only defines a simple rectangular prism for `part_1`.--Correction: The JSON does not fully represent the description, specifically the \\\"cylindrical hole\\\" portion.
