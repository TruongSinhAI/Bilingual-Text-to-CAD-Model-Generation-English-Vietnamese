The base and the bar will be extruded from a 2D sketch. The following instructions will guide you through the process of creating this part. **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** For this part, use the default coordinate system provided in the JSON. The Euler angles are set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], and the translation vector is set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system.

The scaling parameter is provided in the JSON as \"sketch\\\\_scale\": 0.75. **Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate_system specified in the JSON. In this case, the euler angles are [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to generate the 3D model.
