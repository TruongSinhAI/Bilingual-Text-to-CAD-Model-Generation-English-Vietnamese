Perform a cut extrusion of 0.1667 units opposite to the normal without sketch scaling. Apply the CutFeatureOperation during the boolean operation with the previous body. Note: The CAD software might generate the extruded features slightly differently based on specific engineering practices. However, this parametric CAD model should generate the desired shape as closely as possible.</description>",
