Step 7: Extruding the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.75 units towards the normal direction to create the 3D model of a rectangular prism with a hollow center. Part 2: Creating two cylindrical holes on opposite sides of the prism Step 1: Creating the coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.2625, 0.1125, 0.75]. Step 2: Drawing the 2D sketch Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Step 3: Creating circles Create the following circles: 1. Center at [0.0375, 0.0375] and radius of 0.0375 2. Center at [0.0375, 0.4875] and radius of 0.0375 Step 4: Extruding the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude both circles to a depth of 0.75 units towards the opposite direction of normals to create the two cylindrical holes. Final shape The final shape is a 3D model of a rectangular prism with two cylindrical holes on opposite sides. The height, width, and length of each of the intermediate parts and the final shape are 0.75, 0.75, and 0.75 units respectively.</description>",
