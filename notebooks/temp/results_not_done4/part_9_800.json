Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane (face\\\\_1). Step 2: Draw the curves 1. Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.0). 2. Draw a line from point (0.75, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.25). 3. Draw a line from point (0.75, 0.25) to point (0.5, 0.25). 4. Draw a line from point (0.5, 0.25) to point (0.5, 0.5). 5. Draw a line from point (0.5, 0.5) to point (0.25, 0.5). 6. Draw a line from point (0.25, 0.5) to point (0.25, 0.25). 7. Draw a line from point (0.25, 0.25) to point (0.0, 0.25). 8. Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.25) to point (0.0, 0.0). Step 3: Create loops and faces 1. Create a loop with the following lines: line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, line\\\\_4, line\\\\_5, line\\\\_6, line\\\\_7, and line\\\\_8. The loop is closed by the first and last lines. This step forms a single face with multiple edges. Step 4: Scale and extrude the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 (sketch\\\\_scale: 0.75). Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.25 units (extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal: 0.25) along the positive Z-axis. The resulting shape after extrusion is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Notes on height, width and length The height, width, and length of each intermediate part as well as the final shape are as follows: Final shape: * Height: 0.25 * Width: 0.75 * Length: 0.75 These dimensions are provided to assist the junior CAD designer in understanding the size and proportions of the shapes in question. One should keep these values in mind when constructing the individual parts. There is no need to change or update the dimensions, as the provided values are correct. For each part, the same dimensions apply, as the scale factors and extrusion depths are defined in the detailed instructions above.</description>",
