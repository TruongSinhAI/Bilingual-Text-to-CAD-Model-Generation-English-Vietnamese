Step 3: Scale the Sketch Scale the entire sketch by 0.75, making the dimensions more manageable and easier to work with. Step 4: Transform the Sketch into 3D 1. Set the transformation based on the euler angles and translation_vector: * euler angles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * translation_vector = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 2. Extrude the first face (`face_1`) by 0.2425 units (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`). 3. Extrude the second face by a distance described in the 'extrude_depth_opposite_normal' field, which is 0.0 units in this case. The part is now complete. This model represents a 3D rectangular prism with a smaller rectangular prism cut out of its center. The height of the larger prism is about 0.2425 units, the width and length are both 0.75 units, and the height of the smaller prism varies depending on the specific details desired.
