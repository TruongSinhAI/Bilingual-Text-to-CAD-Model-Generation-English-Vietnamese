This would mean `line_1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.1232, 0.0]`, etc. However, the JSON for `part_3`'s `loop_1` is: `line_1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.0, 0.1848]`, `line_2: [0.0, 0.1848] to [0.0, 0.3697]`, etc. This is a **significant mismatch** in the sketch geometry for `loop_1`.\\n    - Sketch `loop_2`: Circle details match JSON.\\n    - Extrusion `operation`: Description \"\n        , \"join it with the previous bodies\"\n        , \" implies \"\n        , \"JoinFeatureOperation\"\n        , \".
