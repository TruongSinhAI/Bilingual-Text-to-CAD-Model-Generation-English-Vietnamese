The shape has a length of 0.0293 units, a width of 0.0293 units, and a height of 0.75 units. **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the Euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** On the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system, create a new sketch and draw a rectangle by following these steps: 1. Draw the first line from the point [0.0, 0.0] to the point [0.0293, 0.0]. 2. Draw the second line from the point [0.0293, 0.0] to the point [0.0293, 0.0293]. 3.

Then, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis with the following properties: - Extrude depth toward the normal: 0.75 units - Extrude depth opposite the normal: 0 units - Sketch scale: 0.0293 With these instructions, you'll create the first part of the CAD modelâ€”a long, thin, rectangular object with a flat top and bottom, slightly curved sides, and tapered towards one end.</description>",
