Without the complete description for part 2's sketch and its extrusion, a full validation and comparison with the JSON for part 2 is not possible.- Part 3: The description provides no information about part 3, which is present in the JSON.- Conclusion: Due to the severe truncation and incompleteness of the description, especially for part 2's extrusion and the complete absence of part 3, the description does not fully match the provided JSON.

The opposing direction should be 0 units. Apply the sketch scale factor of 0.75 and set the operation to joining or adding material.
