The sides are parallel and the front and back faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions are 2 units long, 1 unit wide, and 0.5 units tall. 1. **Create a new coordinate system**. Set the Euler angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 2. **Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane**. Draw six lines to form a closed loop: ```lua line_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.0278, 0.0) line_2: Start Point (0.0278, 0.0), End Point (0.0278, 0.0278) line_3: Start Point (0.0278, 0.0278), End Point (0.0261, 0.0278) line_4: Start Point (0.0261, 0.0278), End Point (0.0261, 0.0017) line_5: Start Point (0.0261, 0.0017), End Point (0.0, 0.0017) line_6: Start Point (0.0, 0.0017), End Point (0.0, 0.0) ``` 3. **Scale the 2D sketch**. Multiply all dimensions by 0.0278 for a scaling factor of 0.0278. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch**. Use the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch**. Extrude the sketch by a distance of 0.75 units along the normal of the sketch plane, with no extrusion in the opposite direction. This will give you a rectangular prism, 2 units long, 1 unit wide, and 0.5 units tall (from the initial sketch).
