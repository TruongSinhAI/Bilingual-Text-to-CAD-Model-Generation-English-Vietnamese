    "prompt": "<description>**Instructions for Part 1:** Construct a rectangular prism with a square base and a square top. The top is offset from the base by a distance equal to the height of the prism. The prism is centered on a vertical axis. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.2485. Within this coordinate system, create a face (face\\\\_1) and a loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face. The loop contains eight lines (line\\\\_1 through line\\\\_8) connecting the following points: * Line 1: (0.0, 0.497) to (0.253, 0.497) * Line 2: (0.253, 0.497) to (0.253, 0.0) * Line 3: (0.253, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0) * Line 4: (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.2485) * Line 5: (0.75, 0.2485) to (0.497, 0.2485) * Line 6: (0.497, 0.2485) to (0.497, 0.7454) * Line 7: (0.497, 0.7454) to (0.0, 0.7454) * Line 8: (0.0, 0.7454) to (0.0, 0.497) Scale this sketch by a factor of 0.75. Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal by 0.2485 units and in the opposite direction of the normal by 0 units. This completes part 1 with the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.2485 **Instructions for Part 2:** Construct a cylindrical hole in the center of part 1. The diameter of the hole is smaller than the prism, and it is centered on the vertical axis. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 180.0 and a translation vector of 0.5015, 0.2485, 0.2485. Within this coordinate system, create a face (face\\\\_1) and a loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face.

Extrude the scaled sketch along the normal by 0.2485 units and in the opposite direction of the normal by 0 units. This completes part 2 with the following dimensions: * Length: 0.2485 * Width: 0.2485 * Height: 0.2485 The final shape is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat top and bottom. The cylindrical hole is centered and has a smaller diameter than the prism. The prism is white.
