Specifically, for Part 1 Face 1, the order of `(0.7017, 0.3368)` and `(0.7017, 0.3333)` is reversed compared to JSON's line flow. For Part 1 Face 2, the starting point `(0.6982, 0.3333)` of the described loop does not match JSON's `line_1` start `[0.6982, 0.0]`. For Part 2 Face 2, the JSON contains an extra point `[0.2228, 0.0]` and an extra line segment (`line_4` and `line_5` use it) that are not explicitly laid out in the description's path.\\n</think>"

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and the translation vector to 0.0, 0.075, 0.0. This will position and orient the sketch plane for the first part. Next, create the 2D sketch on the sketch plane. Begin with a rectangle by drawing four lines as follows: 1. A line from 0.0, 0.0 to 0.3375, 0.0. 2. A line from 0.3375, 0.0 to 0.3375, 0.75. 3.

Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Extend the sketch with a depth of 0.075 towards the normal and a depth of 0 for the opposite direction of the normals. This step concludes the creation of the first part, a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. It measures 0.75 in length, 0.075 in width, and 0.75 in height. Part 2: Construct a slightly tapered rectangular prism Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 180.0, 0.0, -90.0 and the translation vector to 0.3375, 0.075, 0.0. This will position and orient the sketch plane for the second part, which is a slightly tapered rectangular prism. Next, create the 2D sketch on the sketch plane. Begin with a rectangle by drawing four lines as follows: 1. A line from 0.0, 0.0 to 0.3375, 0.0. 2. A line from 0.3375, 0.0 to 0.3375, 0.075. 3. A line from 0.3375, 0.075 to 0.0, 0.075. 4.

Scale the 2D sketch using the sketch scale parameter. The value is 0.3375. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system defined earlier. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Extend the sketch with a depth of 0.675 towards the normal and a depth of 0 for the opposite direction of the normals. This step concludes the creation of the second part, a slightly tapered rectangular prism. It measures 0.3375 in length, 0.675 in width, and 0.3375 in height.

Set the Euler angles to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and the translation vector to 0.0, 0.075, 0.0. This will position and orient the sketch plane for the first part. Next, create the 2D sketch on the sketch plane. Begin with a rectangle by drawing four lines as follows: 1. A line from 0.0, 0.0 to 0.3375, 0.0. 2. A line from 0.3375, 0.0 to 0.3375, 0.75. 3. A line from 0.3375, 0.75 to 0.0, 0.75. 4. A line from 0.0, 0.75 to 0.0, 0.0. This sketch represents a rectangle with vertices at (0.0, 0.0), (0.3375, 0.0), (0.3375, 0.75), and (0.0, 0.75) making four faces, and two loops. Scale the 2D sketch using the sketch scale parameter. The value is 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system defined earlier. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Extend the sketch with a depth of 0.075 towards the normal and a depth of 0 for the opposite direction of the normals. Part 2: Construct a slightly tapered rectangular prism Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to 180.0, 0.0, -90.0 and the translation vector to 0.3375, 0.075, 0.0. This will position and orient the sketch plane for the second part, which is a slightly tapered rectangular prism. Next, create the 2D sketch on the sketch plane. Begin with a rectangle by drawing four lines as follows: 1. A line from 0.0, 0.0 to 0.3375, 0.0. 2. A line from 0.3375, 0.0 to 0.3375, 0.075. 3. A line from 0.3375, 0.075 to 0.0, 0.075. 4.

Scale the 2D sketch using the sketch scale parameter. The value is 0.3375. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system defined earlier. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model.
