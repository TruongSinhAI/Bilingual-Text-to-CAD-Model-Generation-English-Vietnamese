Apply this scale factor to the sketch. **Step 3: Transform the Sketch into a 3D Sketch** The euler angles for the transformation are 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0. The translation vector is (0, 0, 0). Apply these values to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. **Step 4: Extrude the Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.0525. The extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0. The dimension of this intermediate part is a square with a length and width of 0.75 units, and with a height of 0.0525 units. Generated model: A rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The flat top and bottom are squares with a length and width of 0.75 units, and with a height of 0.0525 units. The curved side is a rectangle with a length and width of 0.75 units, and with a height of 0.0525 units. Continue to the next part by referencing the boolean operation for the current part with the previous part. For example, if the boolean operation for this part is \"JoinFeatureOperation\", then the instruction for the next part should begin with: \"Construct the next part by joining the curved side of the rectangular prism with the next shape.\" Then proceed with the detailed step-by-step instructions for the next part as provided in the CAD Assembly JSON. This concludes the instructions for the first intermediate part. Move on to the next part and generate the model as per the JSON instructions. Make sure to use the same clear headings, section breaks, and imperative tone for the instructions for each part. Also, remember to mention the height, width, and length for each intermediate part and the final shape.</description>",
