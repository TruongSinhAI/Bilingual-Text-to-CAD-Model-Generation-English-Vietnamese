Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [ -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 ] * Translation Vector: [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] 2. Create the sketch for part 1: 1. Draw the first face with a single loop (loop\\\\_1) containing a circle (circle\\\\_1) at: * Center: [ 0.375, 0.375 ] * Radius: 0.375 2. Create the second face with a single loop (loop\\\\_2) containing a circle (circle\\\\_1) at: * Center: [ 0.375, 0.375 ] * Radius: 0.2188 3. Scale the 2D sketch using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter (0.75) in the extrusion. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 5. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model according to the extrusion properties: * Extrude\\\\_depth: 0.375 towards the normal * Extrude\\\\_depth (opposite direction of normal): 0.0 * Sketch scale: 0.75 6. The resulting part is the base for the cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. **Notes**: - Each loop is closed and all circles are defined by their center and radius. - The final shape's height is determined by the height of part\\\\_1 after the extrusion, equating to 0.75 units. - The taper is a result of the difference in radius between the two circles in the sketches, with the larger one being 0.375 units and the smaller one at 0.2188 units. - The width is derived from the dimensions of the flat top and bottom surfaces created after extrusion. Since loop\\\\_1 in both faces corresponds to the same circular shape, the width is equal to 2 times the radius of loop\\\\_1, which is 2 x 0.375 = 0.75 units. - The length is determined by the dimensions of the flat bottom surface derived from the dimensions of loop\\\\_2 in face\\\\_1. Since loop\\\\_2 is a circle with a radius of 0.2188, the length is simply equal to the diameter of loop\\\\_2, which is 2 x 0.2188 = 0.4376 units. However, for this specific example, the length, width, and height are provided for reference, but as there is no explicit indication of length and width in the JSON, it might not always apply.</description>",

The prism has a series of evenly spaced holes along its length. The holes are cylindrical in shape and are arranged in a straight line, centered on a vertical axis. Coordinate System 1. Create a new coordinate system. 2. Set the Euler angles as follows: * X-axis Angle: 0.0 degrees * Y-axis Angle: 0.0 degrees * Z-axis Angle: -90.0 degrees 3. Set the translation vector as follows: * X: 0.0 * Y: 0.75 * Z: 0.0 Sketching 1. Create a new sketch on the XY plane. 2. First, create a rectangle by adding a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.0525, 0.0), followed by a line from point (0.0525, 0.0) to point (0.0525, 0.0499), then a line from point (0.0525, 0.0499) to point (0.0, 0.0499), and, finally, another line from point (0.0, 0.0499) to point (0.0, 0.0).

To create the holes along the length, first, create a smaller rectangle at the center of Face 1 with a line from point (0.0273, 0.0032) to point (0.0252, 0.0032), followed by a line from point (0.0252, 0.0032) to point (0.0252, 0.0467), then a line from point (0.0252, 0.0467) to point (0.0273, 0.0467), and, finally, another line from point (0.0273, 0.0467) to point (0.0273, 0.0032). Extrusion 1. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.0525. 2. Extrude Face 1 with a depth of 0.75 units in the positive Z-axis direction (towards the normal) and 0 units in the opposite direction.
