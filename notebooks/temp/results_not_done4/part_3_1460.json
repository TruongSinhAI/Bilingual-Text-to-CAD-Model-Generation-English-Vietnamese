The top of the prism is wider than the bottom, and the sides are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. **Step 1: Create the Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] **Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch** Next, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the newly created coordinate system. The sketch should have one face, and the face should have one loop. **Step 3: Create the Loop** Create the loop as follows: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0623, 0.25] * Line 2: Start Point [0.0623, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.5] * Line 3: Start Point [0.0, 0.5], End Point [0.3175, 0.5] * Line 4: Start Point [0.3175, 0.5], End Point [0.2552, 0.25] * Line 5: Start Point [0.2552, 0.25], End Point [0.3175, 0.0] * Line 6: Start Point [0.3175, 0.0], End Point [0.0, 0.0] **Step 4: Scale the Sketch** Scale the sketch using the sketch scaling parameter of 0.5. **Step 5: Transform the Sketch into 3D** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 6: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.75 units towards the normal direction, and a depth of 0.0 units towards the opposite direction of the normal. This completes the construction of the first part, which has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.5 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.5</description>",
