The prism has a flat top and bottom. The cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 4 units long, 2 units wide, and 1 unit tall. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of approximately 0.5 units. **Coordinate System Setup** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following Euler Angles and Translation Vector: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0625, 0.0] **Sketch 2D Shape for Part 1** Next, draw the 2D shape for Part 1 on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The shape consists of two loops: loop_1 and loop_2. **Loop_1** Loop_1 contains 5 line segments: * Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0], End Point = [0.5937, 0.1562] * Line 3: Start Point = [0.5937, 0.1562], End Point = [0.3125, 0.1562] * Arc 1: Start Point = [0.3125, 0.1562], Mid Point = [0.1875, 0.2812], End Point = [0.0625, 0.1562] * Line 4: Start Point = [0.0625, 0.1562], End Point = [0.0, 0.1562] To close the loop, draw Line_5: * Line 5: Start Point = [0.0, 0.1562], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] **Loop_2** Loop_2 only contains one circle and no line segments: * Circle 1: Center = [0.1875, 0.1562], Radius = 0.0625 **Extrusion Setup** After creating the 2D shape, perform the following extrusion operation: * Extrude_depth_towards_normal = 0.0625 * Extrude_depth_opposite_normal = 0.0 * Sketch_scale = 0.75 * Operation: This operation results in the creation of a new solid body (equivalent to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\") Finally, this will create a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat top and bottom. The cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 4 units long, 2 units wide, and 1 unit tall. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of approximately 0.5 units. {Your answer should not exceed 2000 words} Your answer is almost complete! However, since there are strict guidelines regarding character count, I will provide you with the final part of the instructions, which will fit within the required length: **Length, Width, and Height of Part 1** The height of the rectangular prism, including the cylindrical hole, is 0.75 units. The width of the rectangular prism is 2 units, while the length (the longest side) is 4 units, considering the cylindrical hole. The cylindrical hole's diameter is about 0.5 units, with half of the hole's diameter present on each side of the rectangular prism's length. Keep these measurements in mind while creating the CAD model. Congratulations, you have completed the detailed instructions for the given CAD Assembly JSON!</description>",

The prism has a flat top and bottom. The cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 4 units long, 2 units wide, and 1 unit tall. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of approximately 0.5 units. **Coordinate System Setup** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following Euler Angles and Translation Vector: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0625, 0.0] **Sketch 2D Shape for Part 1** Next, draw the 2D shape for Part 1 on a plane defined by the coordinate system.
