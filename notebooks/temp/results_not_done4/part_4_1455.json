The JSON, however, uses a \\\"Mid Point\\\" definition for the arc, with `Mid Point: [0.3673, 0.3355]`. An arc's midpoint is a point *on* the arc, halfway between its start and end points. An arc's center is the point from which all points on the arc are equidistant (by the radius). These are distinct concepts. The coordinates `(0.3673, 0.3355)` cannot be both the center and the midpoint of the same arc segment (unless the arc is a full circle and this is the center, but it's an arc segment). Given the JSON's \\\"Mid Point\\\" structure, the description's \\\"center\\\" reference at the same coordinates is a direct contradiction or misrepresentation of the JSON's geometric definition.
