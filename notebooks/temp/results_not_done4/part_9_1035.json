Add any necessary constraints to enforce correct geometry relationships. Fully Define the Sketch Make sure to fully define the sketch with necessary constraints to avoid any future issues when converting the sketch to a 3D model. Step 3: 3D Sketch Transformation Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system defined in step 1. Step 4: Extrusion Extrude the 3D sketch according to the \"extrusion\" property within the JSON: Extrude Depth Towards Normal: 0.1985 Extrude Depth Opposite Normal: 0.0 Sketch Scale: 0.6618 This results in a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center.

Fully Define the Sketch: Make sure to fully define the sketch with necessary constraints to avoid any future issues when converting the sketch to a 3D model.
