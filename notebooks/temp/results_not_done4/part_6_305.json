    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.** *The first part of the CAD assembly is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The height of the prism is twice its width, and the length is three times its width. The sides of the prism are parallel to each other.* **Step 1: Create the coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.0026, 0.0) **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** * Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. * Draw a rectangle by creating four lines as follows: 1. Line 1: Starting point (0.0, 0.0) and ending point (0.1875, 0.0). 2. Line 2: Starting point (0.1875, 0.0) and ending point (0.1875, 0.75). 3. Line 3: Starting point (0.1875, 0.75) and ending point (0.0, 0.75). 4. Line 4: Starting point (0.0, 0.75) and ending point (0.0, 0.0). **Step 3: Scale and transform the 2D sketch** * Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. * Transform the sketched plane using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch** * Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal to a depth of 0.0026 units. * Set the opposite normal extrusion depth to 0. * Apply a sketch scale factor of 0.75 to the sketch before extruding. **Extra details** The part has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.0026 units * Height: 0.75 units Given that the instructions provided do not include any additional assumptions, we can now proceed to generate the 2D sketch and extrude it into a 3D model using the specified steps. The result will be a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the height is twice the width and the length is three times the width. The sides of the prism are parallel to each other. By following the specified coordinate system, curves, loops, and faces, we can ensure that the resulting CAD model is accurate and meets the required specifications. The imperative tone of the instructions makes it clear what steps need to be taken, and the avoidance of specific boolean operation terms allows for a more straightforward implementation. The final CAD model should reflect the intended design, which is a rectangular prism with the specified dimensions and features. The extrusion depth and scaling factor should be applied as indicated, and the resulting model should be a single, solid body. With these instructions in hand, a junior CAD designer should be able to generate an accurate and complete CAD model for the first part of the assembly.</description>",
