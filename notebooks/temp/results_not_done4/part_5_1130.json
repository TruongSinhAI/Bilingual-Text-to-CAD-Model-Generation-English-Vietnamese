Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. 2. Draw a closed loop on the X-Y plane consisting of four lines with the following end points: - line_1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0) - line_2: (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.6591) - line_3: (0.75, 0.6591) to (0.0, 0.6591) - line_4: (0.0, 0.6591) to (0.0, 0.0) **Step 2: Scaling the 2D Sketch** 1. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75, such that the width and length of the rectangle are both 2 units. **Step 3: Transforming the 2D Sketch into a 3D Sketch** 1. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.053. **Step 4: Extruding the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** 1.
