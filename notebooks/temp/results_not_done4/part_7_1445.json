    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Creating a Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism First, we will create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The prism has a series of parallel lines along its length, and a single line along its width. The top and bottom edges are straight, and the sides are flat. 1. **Create a new coordinate system.** Set the Euler angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.6667, 0.0, 0.0]. 2. **Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane.** 2.1. **Create the first loop (loop\\_1) on the X-Y plane.** - Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.385, 0.0]. - Draw a line from point [0.385, 0.0] to point [0.385, 0.085]. - Draw a line from point [0.385, 0.085] to point [0.0, 0.085]. - Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.085] to point [0.0, 0.0]. 2.2. **Create the second loop (loop\\_2) on the X-Y plane.** - Draw a line from point [0.0208, 0.0208] to point [0.3642, 0.0208]. - Draw a line from point [0.3642, 0.0208] to point [0.3642, 0.0642]. - Draw a line from point [0.3642, 0.0642] to point [0.0208, 0.0642]. - Draw a line from point [0.0208, 0.0642] to point [0.0208, 0.0208]. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch by 0.385 in all directions.** 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch and give it a height of 0.385 units.** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.385 units. 5. **Create a new solid body using the extruded 3D sketch.** Part 2: Adding a Sloped Side to the Rectangular Prism Next, we will add a sloped side to the rectangular prism. 1. **Create a new coordinate system with the same properties as before.** 2. **Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane.** 2.1. **Create two loops identical to the ones created in Part 1 (loop\\_1 and loop\\_2).** 3. **Scale the 2D sketch by 0.385 in all directions.** 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch and give it a height of 0.0833 units.** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0833 units. 5. **Join the new extrusion with the existing solid body.** This will create a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The final shape will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side, where the length is 0.6667 units, the width is 0.385 units, and the height is 0.385 units (including the sloped side). The sloped side has a height of 0.0833 units.</description>",
