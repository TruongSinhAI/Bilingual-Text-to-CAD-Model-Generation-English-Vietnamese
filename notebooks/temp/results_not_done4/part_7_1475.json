The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the middle section is slightly narrower than the top and bottom. The sides of the prism are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will define the coordinate system for the 2D sketch. **Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch** Draw a rectangle with four lines on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. The lines should have the following start and end points: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.2817, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.2817, 0.0], End Point [0.2817, 0.3003] - Line 3: Start Point [0.2817, 0.3003], End Point [0.0, 0.3003] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.3003], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This rectangle will form the top and bottom faces of the prism, while the two vertical lines will form the sides of the prism. **Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.3003.

This will create the 3D model of the prism, with a height of 0.75 units. The final size of the prism is as follows: - Length: 0.3003 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.3003 units The prism has a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section.
