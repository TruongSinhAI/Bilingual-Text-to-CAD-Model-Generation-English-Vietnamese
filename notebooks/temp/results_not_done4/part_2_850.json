Note that the rounded corners are represented as small circular arcs or fillets within the sketch.

There are no lines or other loops within this hole. After completing the 2D sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following properties: - Extrude depth towards normal: 0.1786 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 - Sketch scale: 0.75 - Operation: New solid body The resulting part will have the following dimensions: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.1786 units This completes the instructions for part 1 of the CAD model.</description>",
