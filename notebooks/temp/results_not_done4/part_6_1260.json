    "reasoning": "<description> Part 1 - Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Middle Section Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation (euler\\\\_angles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.1, 0.0]. This will position the prism slightly above the origin. Sketch Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. 1. Draw line 1 from the point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.0833, 0.0). 2. Draw line 2 from the point (0.0833, 0.0) to point (0.0833, 0.0667). 3. Draw line 3 from the point (0.0833, 0.0667) to point (0.0333, 0.0667). 4. Draw line 4 from the point (0.0333, 0.0667) to point (0.0333, 0.1333). 5. Draw line 5 from the point (0.0333, 0.1333) to point (0.0833, 0.1333). 6. Draw line 6 from the point (0.0833, 0.1333) to point (0.0833, 0.2). 7. Draw line 7 from the point (0.0833, 0.2) to point (0.0, 0.2). 8. Draw line 8 from the point (0.0, 0.2) to point (0.0, 0.0). This sketch forms a closed loop with 8 lines. Extrusion Extrude the sketch along the normal vector with a depth of 0.2667, and no extrusion in the opposite direction.
