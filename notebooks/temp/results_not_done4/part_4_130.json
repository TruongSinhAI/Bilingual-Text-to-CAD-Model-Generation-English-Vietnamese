The total length of this sketch is approximately 0.75 units, and the width is approximately 0.51 units. The height of the sketch is determined by the z-value of the coordinate system. After you have created the 2D sketch, scale it using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter with a value of 0.75. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.5067, 0.0] Finally, extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use an extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal value of 0.5067 units and an extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal value of 0 units. Set the sketch\\\\_scale value to 0.75 and apply the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" operation. Summary The resulting part is a rectangular prism with a slightly angled top surface and a slightly tapered shape. The length, width, and height of this part are approximately 0.75, 0.51, and 0.51 units, respectively. The part is created as a new body and added to the assembly.</description>",
