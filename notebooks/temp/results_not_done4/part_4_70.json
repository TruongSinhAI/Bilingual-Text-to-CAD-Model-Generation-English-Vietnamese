Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch with euler angles [0, 0, 0] and a translation vector of [0, 0, 0]. Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model with a depth towards the normal of 0.0469 inches and depth opposite the normal as 0.0 inches. **Part 2: Construct a series of cylindrical objects, varying in height, arranged in a horizontal line.** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0, 0, 0], a translation vector of [0.0281, 0.0281, 0.0469]. Generate a sketch on face_1 with a single circle: - circle_1: Radius 0.0281 inches at [0.0281, 0.0281] For face_2, create a sketch with a single circle: - circle_1: Radius 0.0281 inches at [0.0281, 0.3094] Repeat this process for the circles on faces 3, 4, 5, and 6. Using the sketch_scale parameter, scale the 2D sketches with a factor of 0.6937. Perform a cut extrusion on the scaled 2D sketches with a depth towards the normal of 0.0 inches and depth opposite the normal as 0.1875 inches. This will yield cylindrical objects arranged in a horizontal line, varying in height. With the completion of **Part_2**, this now concludes the instructions for generating the CAD assembly model. This model consists of a rectangular metal plate with four holes arranged around the edges, as described in the given CAD Assembly JSON.</description>",

At this point, the first part is constructed. Additional parts will be created in the same fashion according to the CAD Assembly JSON. The final shape will be a long, rectangular, flat object with a slightly curved top edge. In general, the process for generating parametric CAD models consists of creating a 2D sketch, scaling, transforming the sketch into 3D space, and then extruding to create a 3D solid. By repeating these steps for the various intermediate parts listed in the CAD Assembly JSON, the desired final shape can be constructed. For this specific example, we start by creating a long, rectangular, flat object with a gently curved top edge using the aforementioned steps. If necessary, further parts will be added to create more complex geometries.</description>",
