    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a hollow center The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a hollow center, featuring a flat bottom and a flat top. The prism is composed of six rectangular faces, with the front face being the only one with a visible opening. The opening is rectangular and is located in the center of the prism. The prism is symmetrical along its central axis. The following are the detailed instructions to construct this part. Creating the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles as (0°, 0°, 0°) and translation vector as (0, 0, 0). This will be the reference coordinate system for the entire part. Creating the Sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch will have two rectangular loops, one inside the other. The inner loop defines the hollow center of the prism, while the outer loop defines the outer boundary of the prism. Inner Loop The inner loop is a rectangle with four straight lines. Draw the first line from point (0, 0) to point (0.75, 0). The second line starts from point (0.75, 0) and ends at point (0.75, 0.5197). The third line starts from point (0.75, 0.5197) and ends at point (0, 0.5197). The fourth line starts from point (0, 0.5197) and ends at point (0, 0). This completes the inner rectangular loop. Outer Loop The outer loop is also a rectangle, but slightly bigger than the inner loop. Draw the first line from point (0.0416, 0.0674) to point (0.7119, 0.0674). The second line starts from point (0.7119, 0.0674) and ends at point (0.7119, 0.473). The third line starts from point (0.7119, 0.473) and ends at point (0.0416, 0.473). The fourth line starts from point (0.0416, 0.473) and ends at point (0.0416, 0.0674). This completes the outer rectangular loop. Extruding the Sketch Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by a distance of 0.4888 units. This will create the three-dimensional prism with a hollow center. Part Details The length of the part is 0.75 units, the width is also 0.75 units, and the height is 0.4888 units. The part is created using the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" boolean operation. The final shape of this part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a hollow center, featuring a flat bottom and a flat top. The prism is composed of six rectangular faces, with the front face being the only one with a visible opening. The opening is rectangular and is located in the center of the prism. The prism is symmetrical along its central axis.</description>",
