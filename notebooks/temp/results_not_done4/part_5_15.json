This sketch will form the profile of the rectangular prism with a curved side. Step 3: Draw the lines for the rectangle 1. Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.0003, 0.0]. 2. Draw a line from point [0.0003, 0.0] to point [0.0003, 0.1252]. 3. Draw a line from point [0.0003, 0.1252] to point [0.0, 0.1252]. 4. Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.1252] to point [0.0, 0.0]. Step 4: Draw the curved side of the rectangle Draw an arc that connects the end points of line_1 and line_3, with a center point at the midpoint of line_2. The radius should be the distance between the center point and the end point of line_2. Step 5: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.1252. Step 6: Transform the scaled 2D sketch to 3D Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the following parameters: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.0] Step 7: Extrude the 3D model Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0.1875 in both directions of the normal. This will create the final shape of the rectangular prism with a curved side. Final Shape The final shape is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. The prism is centered in the image.</description>",
