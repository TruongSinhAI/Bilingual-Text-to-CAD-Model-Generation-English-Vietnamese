The sketch will have a single face (face\\\\_1). face\\\\_1 will have one loop (loop\\\\_1). loop\\\\_1 will be closed and will consist of 4 lines: - line\\\\_1: Start Point [0, 0], End Point [0.375, 0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.375, 0], End Point [0.375, 0.75] - line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.375, 0.75], End Point [0, 0.75] - line\\\\_4: Start Point [0, 0.75], End Point [0, 0] 3. **Scale the 2D sketch:** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch:** Use the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch:** Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.1875 towards the normal. Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0 towards the opposite direction of the normal. The extrusion will result in a rectangular prism with a height, width and length of 0.75, 0.1875, 0.75 respectively. 6. **Create a cylindrical hole in the rectangular prism:** This step is not explicitly defined in the json, but assuming that the final shape needs a cylindrical hole, you can create it by subtracting a cylinder from the rectangular prism. The cylinder should be slightly larger than the prism's width and positioned at the center of the prism's face. The final shape would be a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The overall dimensions of the final shape would be: - Length: 0.75 - Width: 0.1875 - Height: 0.75 Note: The above instructions are provided assuming that the final shape is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole. The actual shape to be constructed would depend on the values in the description field of the json.</description>",

Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. Step 3: Draw the first cylindrical surface Draw a circle with a center at (0.0443, 0.0443) and a radius of 0.0443. Step 4: Draw the second cylindrical surface Draw a circle with a center at (0.0443, 0.1919) and a radius of 0.0443. Step 5: Draw the third cylindrical surface Draw a circle with a center at (0.0443, 0.3396) and a radius of 0.0443. Step 6: Scale the 2D sketch Using a scaling factor of 0.3839, scale the 2D sketch non-uniformly. Step 7: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Rotate the scaled 2D sketch around the Z-axis by 0 degrees, X-axis by 0 degrees, and Y-axis by 0 degrees. Translate the scaled and rotated 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0. Translate the scaled and rotated 2D sketch along the X-axis by 0.2418, and along the Y-axis by 0.4013. Step 8: Extrude the 2D sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by -0.2049, removing material and creating a cylindrical object with three parallel ridges on its surface. This will result in a negative extrusion depth of 0.2049 towards the opposite direction of normals. Final Shape The final shape will be a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom, and a vertical rectangular opening on the right side. The opening is centered and has a curved top that matches the top of the prism. The prism has a height of 0.03, width of 0.75, and length of 0.75. The cylindrical object has a height of 0.2049, width of 0.3839, and length of 0.3839. The prism is white, with the cylindrical object removed from its volume.</description>",
