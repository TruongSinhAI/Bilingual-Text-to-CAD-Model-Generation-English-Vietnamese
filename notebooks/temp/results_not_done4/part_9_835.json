The length, width, and height of this part are 0.75 units, 0.75 units, and 0.075 units, respectively. *Construction Instructions* 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles and translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] for all axes. 2. Create the base 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. * Draw a circle with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375 units. This circle represents the flat top or bottom of the cylindrical object. 3. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system. 5. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis with an extrusion depth of 0.075 units towards the normal and 0 extrusion depth opposite the normal. Use the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" to integrate the part with the previous CAD models, adding material to create a solid body. **Part 2: Flat Rectangular Plate** *Shape and Dimensions* Create a flat rectangular plate. The length, width, and height of this part are 1.5 units, 1.5 units, and 0.1 units, respectively. *Construction Instructions* 1. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles and translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] for all axes. 2. Create the base 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. * Draw a rectangle with its vertices at (-0.75, -0.75), (-0.75, 0.75), (0.75, 0.75), and (0.75, -0.75). This rectangle has a width of 1.5 units and a length of 1.5 units. 3. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor based on the desired dimensions or a specified sketch_scale parameter. 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system. 5. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis with an extrusion depth of 0.1 units towards the normal and 0 extrusion depth opposite the normal. Use the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" to integrate the part with the previous CAD models, adding material to create a solid body. *Note*: In Part 2, the flat plate is added to the assembly by extruding along the Z-axis, which is perpendicular to the previously created cylindrical object. This will join the top flat surface of the cylindrical object with the plate, forming a single part.</description>",
