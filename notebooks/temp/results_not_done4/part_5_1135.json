We'll start by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of [0, 0, 0]. 1. **Create Coordinate System** * Euler Angles: [0, 0, 0] * Translation Vector: [0, 0, 0] Now, let's draw the 2D sketch for this part. We'll create two circles, one for the outer edge of the cylinder and another for the inner hole. The outer circle has a radius of 0.375 and the inner circle has a radius of 0.3542, both centered at [0.375, 0.375]. 1. **Draw 2D Sketch** * Create two circles in face 1: * Outer Circle (circle\\\\_1): * Center: [0.375, 0.375] * Radius: 0.375 * Inner Circle (circle\\\\_1): * Center: [0.375, 0.375] * Radius: 0.3542 Next, we'll extrude the 2D sketch to create the cylindrical object. Since this part has a 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', we'll extrude it to a depth of 0.0278 towards the normal and not at all in the opposite direction. 1. **Extrude 2D Sketch** * Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0278 * Extrude depth opposite normal: 0 * Sketch scale: 0.75 The final dimensions of this part are as follows: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.0278 Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Flat Top, Bottom, and Curved Side The second part is a cylindrical object with a flat top, bottom, and curved side. We'll start by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of [0, 0, 0]. 1. **Create Coordinate System** * Euler Angles: [0, 0, 0] * Translation Vector: [0, 0, 0] Now, let's draw the 2D sketch for this part. We'll create two circles, just like in part 1. The outer circle has a radius of 0.375, and the inner circle has a radius of 0.3542, both centered at [0.375, 0.375]. 1. **Draw 2D Sketch** * Create two circles in face 1: * Outer Circle (circle\\\\_1): * Center: [0.375, 0.375] * Radius: 0.375 * Inner Circle (circle\\\\_1): * Center: [0.375, 0.375] * Radius: 0.3542 Next, we'll extrude the 2D sketch to create the curved side of the cylindrical object.
