Begin by drawing a rectangle on the XY plane, with corner points at (0,0) and (0.4091, 0.0341). This forms the base of the prism. The rectangle should have 4 lines, with line 1 going from (0,0) to (0.4091, 0), line 2 from (0.4091, 0) to (0.4091, 0.0341), line 3 from (0.4091, 0.0341) to (0, 0.0341), and line 4 from (0, 0.0341) to (0, 0). Extruding the base: 2. Extrude the base by 0.0341 units in the positive Z-direction, resulting in a rectangular prism. Part 2: Angled Prism Create a new coordinate system for part 2, located at (0, 0.7159, 0.0341), with no rotation. Sketching the base: 3. Create a rectangle on the XY plane similar to part 1, using the points (0,0), (0.4091, 0), (0.4091, 0.0341), and (0, 0.0341). Extruding the base: 4. Extrude the sketch by 0.6818 units in the direction of the vector (1,1,1), normal to the sketch plane. This angled prism will join with the extruded surface from part 1. Part 3: Taller Prism Create a new coordinate system for part 3 with the same origin and orientation as part 1. Sketching the base: 5. Draw a rectangle on the XY plane similar to parts 1 and 2, with points (0,0), (0.4091, 0), (0.4091, 0.0341), and (0, 0.0341). Extruding the base: 6. Extrude the rectangle by 0.1364 units in the positive Z-direction, joining with the prism from part 1. You should now have a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side made up of three parts â€” a main rectangular prism, an angled prism, and a taller prism. The prism is centered on a white background.</description>",

Each line's Start Point and End Point as described perfectly match the corresponding values in the JSON. The sequence of lines forms a closed loop, ensuring a valid sketch.\\n\\n- Check Part 1 Extrusion:\\n  - The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.0192) matches the JSON.\\n  - The `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0) is consistent with the description, as no extrusion in the opposite direction is mentioned.\\n  - The `sketch_scale` (0.75) matches the JSON.\\n  - The `operation` \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" is a correct inference for creating the initial solid body as described.\\n\\n- Correction: All inferred data from the description matches the JSON precisely. No corrections are necessary.\\n</think>"
