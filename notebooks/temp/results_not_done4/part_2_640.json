    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Sloped Side Step 1: Create the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. The euler angles should be set to 0 degrees in all X, Y, and Z directions, and the translation vector should be set to 0 in X, Y, and Z directions. Step 2: Draw the Sketch For this part, we will be drawing a single face. On the face you are about to create, draw a loop consisting of seven lines: 1. The first line starts at point (0, 0) and ends at point (0.5956, 0). 2. The second line starts at point (0.5956, 0) and ends at point (0.75, 0). 3. The third line starts at point (0.75, 0) and ends at point (0.75, 0.0441). 4. The fourth line starts at point (0.75, 0.0441) and ends at point (0.5956, 0.0441). 5. The fifth line starts at point (0.5956, 0.0441) and ends at point (0.5956, 0.6681). 6. The sixth line starts at point (0.5956, 0.6681) and ends at point (0.0, 0.6681). 7. The seventh line starts at point (0.0, 0.6681) and ends at point (0.0, 0.0). Please note that these lines form a closed loop. Step 3: Scale the Sketch Now scale the sketch by multiplying all points with a scaling factor of 0.75. Step 4: Create the 3D Model Extrude the sketch with a depth of 0.0126 towards the normal, and 0.0 in the opposite direction. After following these steps, you will have constructed a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a sloped side. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 0.75 units in length, 0.75 units in width, and 0.0126 units in height. The sloped side is angled at 45 degrees.</description>",
