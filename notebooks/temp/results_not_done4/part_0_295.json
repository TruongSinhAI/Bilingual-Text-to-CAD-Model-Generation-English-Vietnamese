For the final CAD assembly, you will need to combine Part 1 with the subsequent parts. Refer to the JSON description for each part's boolean operation with the previous body and perform the respective operations to complete the final CAD assembly. Remember, when describing the boolean operation in the instructions for the subsequent parts, avoid using specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation' etc. Instead, use their natural language descriptions like \"create a solid by cutting the current part from the previous part,\" \"create a solid by adding the current part to the previous part,\" etc.</description>",
