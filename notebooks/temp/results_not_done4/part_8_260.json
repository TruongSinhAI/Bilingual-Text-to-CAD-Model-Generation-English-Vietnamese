Within this sketch, follow these instructions to create the required geometry: - Create a rectangle by drawing four lines, as follows: - Line 1: Starting point at [0.0, 0.0], ending point at [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Starting point at [0.75, 0.0], ending point at [0.75, 0.4687] - Line 3: Starting point at [0.75, 0.4687], ending point at [0.0, 0.4687] - Line 4: Starting point at [0.0, 0.4687], ending point at [0.0, 0.0] Step 3: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by the factor specified in the `sketch_scale` parameter: 0.75. Step 4: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Now, transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the positive Z-axis to create a 3D model with the specified depth: - Extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.4687 - Extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 The resulting part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel, and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal, with the height being half the length of the sides (0.75 x 0.75 = 0.5625). Final Shape: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism Follow the instructions above for each of the individual parts. Once the parts have been constructed, they will combine to form the final shape, which is also a three-dimensional rectangular prism with the dimensions described above.</description>",
