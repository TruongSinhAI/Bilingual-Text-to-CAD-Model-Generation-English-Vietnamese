Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0375 units to generate the 3D model. Part 2: Create a CAD model of a cylindrical object with a smaller cylindrical hole in the center. Start by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.2155, 0.1405, 0.0] Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch contains three faces (face\\\\_1, face\\\\_2, and face\\\\_3) with a single loop each, which in turn consist of circles: * face\\\\_1: loop\\\\_1, circle\\\\_1, Center [0.0245, 0.3845], Radius = 0.0245 * face\\\\_2: loop\\\\_1, circle\\\\_1, Center [0.1595, 0.0245], Radius = 0.0245 * face\\\\_3: loop\\\\_1, circle\\\\_1, Center [0.2945, 0.3845], Radius = 0.0245 Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter sketch\\\\_scale = 0.409. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0375 units and apply a CutFeatureOperation to remove the material from the previously constructed part.</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description refers to \\\"Part 1\\\" and \\\"Part 2\\\".\\npart_1:\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (From \\\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\\\")\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.18, 0.0926, 0.0] (From \\\"Translation Vector: [0.18, 0.0926, 0.0]\\\")\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1: (From \\\"one face (face_1)\\\")\\n    - loop_1: (From \\\"single loop (loop_1)\\\")\\n      - line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.39, 0.0]\\n      - line_2: Start Point [0.39, 0.0], End Point [0.39, 0.5074]\\n      - line_3: Start Point [0.39, 0.5074], End Point [0.0, 0.5074]\\n      - line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.5074], End Point [0.0, 0.0]\\n        (All line properties are directly from the description for a rectangle).\\n- extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0375 (From \\\"Extrude... by 0.0375 units\\\")\\n  - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred, as no opposite extrusion is mentioned)\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.5074 (From \\\"scale... using the scaling parameter sketch_scale = 0.5074\\\")\\n  - operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (Inferred from \\\"generate the 3D model\\\" for the first part)\\n\\npart_2:\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (From \\\"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\\\")\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.2155, 0.1405, 0.0] (From \\\"Translation Vector: [0.2155, 0.1405, 0.0]\\\")\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1: (From \\\"face_1... consist of circles\\\")\\n    - loop_1:\\n      - circle_1: Center [0.0245, 0.3845], Radius 0.0245 (From \\\"face_1: loop_1, circle_1, Center [0.0245, 0.3845], Radius = 0.0245\\\")\\n  - face_2: (From \\\"face_2... consist of circles\\\")\\n    - loop_1:\\n      - circle_1: Center [0.1595, 0.0245], Radius 0.0245 (From \\\"face_2: loop_1, circle_1, Center [0.1595, 0.0245], Radius = 0.0245\\\")\\n  - face_3: (From \\\"face_3... consist of circles\\\")\\n    - loop_1:\\n      - circle_1: Center [0.2945, 0.3845], Radius 0.0245 (From \\\"face_3: loop_1, circle_1, Center [0.2945, 0.3845], Radius = 0.0245\\\")\\n- extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0375 (From \\\"Extrude... by 0.0375 units\\\")\\n  - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred, as no opposite extrusion is mentioned)\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.409 (From \\\"Scale... using the scaling parameter sketch_scale = 0.409\\\")\\n  - operation: \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" (From \\\"apply a CutFeatureOperation to remove the material\\\")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n- Part 1:\\n  - Sketch: The four lines form a closed rectangular loop.
