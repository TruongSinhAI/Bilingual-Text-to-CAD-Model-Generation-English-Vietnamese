The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, while the front and back faces are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The sides of the prism are straight and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2:3:4. Coordinate System 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Sketch 1. Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a rectangle by creating four lines: - Line 1: Starting at [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.0]. - Line 2: Starting at [0.75, 0.0] and ending at [0.75, 0.4726]. - Line 3: Starting at [0.75, 0.4726] and ending at [0.0, 0.4726]. - Line 4: Starting at [0.0, 0.4726] and ending at [0.0, 0.0]. Extrusion 1. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 2. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0103 units in the positive direction (towards the normal). 3. Set the operation to 'create a new solid body'. Additional Information * The length of the prism is 0.75 units. * The width of the prism is 0.75 units. * The height of the prism (the dimension along the Z-axis) is 0.0103 units. * The shape of the prism is a rectangular prism with a tapered top and bottom. The tapered faces are parallel to each other and to the X-Y plane. Part 2: Constructing the Final Assembly Coordinate System 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Part 1 1. Place Part 1 in the coordinate system with its bottom-left corner at the origin [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 2. Create a 'join feature operation' between the existing body (which should now contain Part 1) and the new solid body to be created with the following extrusion. Sketch 1. Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Draw a rectangle by creating four lines as described in Part 1. Extrusion 1. Scale the sketch by a factor of 2. 2. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis by 4 units in the positive direction (towards the normal). 3. Set the operation to 'join feature operation'. This will fuse Part 1 with the new solid body. Additional Information * The final shape is a rectangular prism with a tapered top and bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, while the front and back faces are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The sides of the prism are straight and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 2:3:4. Construct the final shape following the above instructions. Note that the length, width, and height of each part are provided.
