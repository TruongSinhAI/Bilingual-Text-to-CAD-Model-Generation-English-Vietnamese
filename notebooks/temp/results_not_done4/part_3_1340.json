Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0804, 0.0]. Now, let's create the 2D sketch. On the XY plane, create a rectangle with the following lines: 1. Line 1: Starting point at [0.0, 0.0], ending point at [0.75, 0.0] 2. Line 2: Starting point at [0.75, 0.0], ending point at [0.75, 0.2679] 3.

The height of the prism is determined by the Z-direction value of the translation vector in the coordinate system (0.0804). Now, let's add the cylindrical holes. On the same 2D sketch, add three circles with the following properties: 1. Circle 1: Center at [0.1339, 0.1071], radius 0.0536 2. Circle 2: Center at [0.375, 0.1071], radius 0.0536 3. Circle 3: Center at [0.6161, 0.1071], radius 0.0536 These circles form the cylindrical holes on the prism. Next, we'll transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 along the X axis, and then apply the Euler rotations and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0804 units (the value of the extrude_depth_towards_normal field). This will produce a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole on one of its faces. The length and width of the prism are both 0.75 units, while the height is 0.0804 units. Each cylindrical hole has a diameter of 0.1072 units (0.0536 x 2) and is also 0.0804 units deep.</description>",

The `operation` is correctly inferred as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" for creating the initial body.- Overall consistency: All explicit numerical values and structural elements from the description are accurately reflected in the JSON.
