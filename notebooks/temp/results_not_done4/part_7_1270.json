Scale the sketch by 0.75. This creates a new solid body with a cylindrical shape and two holes. Use \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" boolean operation to combine this part with previously constructed CAD models. **Part 2: Tapered Cylinder with Ridges** Create the coordinate system with Euler angles 0.0, 0.0, and 180.0. Adjust the translation vector according to the position of the part in the assembly: (0.0069, 0.972, 0.0). 1. **Sketching the first face** Create a new face and loop containing a single circle_1. - Loop 1: Draw circle_1 with its center at (0.0014, 0.0014) and a radius of 0.0014. 2. **Extruding the Sketch** Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.0, and in the opposite direction by 0.0457.
