The sketch contains a single face (face\\\\_1) with a loop\\\\_1 having 4 lines: * Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0]; End Point = [0.75, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0]; End Point = [0.75, 0.544] * Line 3: Start Point = [0.75, 0.544]; End Point = [0.0, 0.544] * Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.544]; End Point = [0.0, 0.0] 1.3 Scale the 2D sketch using the `sketch_scale` scaling parameter as 0.75. 1.4 Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. 1.5 Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model with `extrude_depth_towards_normal` of 0.375 and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is 0.0. Part 2: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with Rounded Corners Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners. 2.1 Create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.375, 0.375, 0.0] 2.2 Draw a 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch contains a single face (face\\\\_1) with a loop\\\\_1 having 4 lines: * Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0]; End Point = [0.375, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point = [0.375, 0.0]; End Point = [0.375, 0.375] * Line 3: Start Point = [0.375, 0.375]; End Point = [0.0, 0.375] * Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.375]; End Point = [0.0, 0.0] 2.3 Scale the 2D sketch using the `sketch_scale` scaling parameter as 0.375. 2.4 Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. 2.5 Extrude the 2D sketch into a 3D model with `extrude_depth_towards_normal` of 0.375 and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is 0.0. The operation at this step is 'JoinFeatureOperation', which means the extruded shape is joined with the previous part in the assembly. As a result, you will have a 3D geometric shape with a rectangular base and a triangular top, connected by a straight line. The length of part 1 is 0.75, width is 0.375, and height is 0.375. The length of part 2 is 0.375, width is 0.375, and height is 0.375. The combined length of both parts and the final shape (considering the overlap of parts) is about 0.85. The width and height are the same as part 1 and part 2.</description>",
