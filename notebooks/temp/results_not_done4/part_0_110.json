    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism The first part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The length of the sides is twice the height of the prism. The height of the prism is one-third of the length of the sides. The prism is centered on the white background. Creating the coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the Euler angles set to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translation vector set to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This will position the prism at the origin of the white background. Drawing the 2D sketch Next, create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw a rectangle by creating four lines: 1. Line 1: Start Point = (0.0, 0.0), End Point = (0.1368, 0.0) 2. Line 2: Start Point = (0.1368, 0.0), End Point = (0.1368, 0.114) 3. Line 3: Start Point = (0.1368, 0.114), End Point = (0.0, 0.114) 4. Line 4: Start Point = (0.0, 0.114), End Point = (0.0, 0.0) This rectangle forms the perimeter of the top and bottom faces of the prism. The dimensions of the rectangle meet the requirements of the prism's length and height. Scaling the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch by the scaling factor 0.1368. This will ensure the prism's length matches the desired dimensions. Transforming the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Use the same coordinate system to translate and rotate the 2D sketch by the given Euler angles to create a 3D sketch. This step will position the scaled rectangle properly within the 3D space Extruding the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by a distance of 0.75 units to generate the 3D prism.
