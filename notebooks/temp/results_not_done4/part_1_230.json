    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: A Rectangular Prism with a Slightly Tapered Shape Step 1: Create the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with a rotation of 0.0 degrees along the x-axis, 0.0 degrees along the y-axis, and -90.0 degrees along the z-axis. Translate it by 0.0 along x, 0.3188 along y, and 0.0 along z. Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch on the Plane Defined by the Coordinate System Create the first face of the sketch as follows: Curve 1: Draw a line from 0.0, 0.0 to 0.0281, 0.0 (on the x-axis) Curve 2: Draw a line from 0.0281, 0.0 to 0.0281, 0.7125 (on the y-axis) Curve 3: Draw an arc from 0.0281, 0.7125 with a radial endpoint at 0.0309, 0.7191, and a tangent endpoint at 0.0375, 0.7219 Curve 4: Draw a line from 0.0375, 0.7219 to 0.2812, 0.7219 (on the x-axis) Curve 5: Draw a line from 0.2812, 0.7219 to 0.2812, 0.75 (on the y-axis) Curve 6: Draw a line from 0.2812, 0.75 to 0.0375, 0.75 (on the x-axis) Curve 7: Draw an arc from 0.0375, 0.75 with a radial endpoint at 0.011, 0.739, and a tangent endpoint at 0.0, 0.7125 Curve 8: Draw a line from 0.0, 0.7125 to 0.0, 0.0 (taking it back to the starting point) The sketch must be closed. This sketch contains two lines and two arcs. Step 3: Convert 2D Sketch into 3D Sketch Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector provided earlier in the coordinate system step. Step 4: Extrude the Sketch into a 3D Model Extrude the 2D sketch along the z-axis, 0.1594 units in the normal direction and an additional 0.1594 units in the opposite direction of the normal. This operation results in a new solid body. Final Details The dimensions of this rectangular prismic part are as follows: - length: 0.75 - width: 0.3187 - height: 0.75 (including the extrusion's height)</description>",
