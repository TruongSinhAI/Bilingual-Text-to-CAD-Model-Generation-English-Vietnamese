The total number of curves (lines) in this sketch is 6. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system. Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal direction by 0.0256 units and along the opposite direction by 0.0256 units. The sketch_scale parameter for this extrusion is 0.75. The resulting part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The height of the prism is approximately twice the width. The dimensions of the prism are as follows: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.0511 units</description>",
