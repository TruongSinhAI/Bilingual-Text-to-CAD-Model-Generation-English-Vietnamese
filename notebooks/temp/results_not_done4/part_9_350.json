    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Slope The first part of the CAD assembly is a rectangular prism with a slope on one side. Let's get started. 1. **Create a new coordinate system**, aligned with the Euler Angles `[-90, 0, -90]` and with a Translation Vector of `[0, 0.5447, 0]`. This configuration will allow you to draw a 2D sketch on a plane parallel to the X-Z plane, but displaced vertically. 2. **Draw a 2D sketch** on the created coordinate system. 3. Create a rectangle using the **four lines** specified in the `face_1` of `sketch`: * `line_1`: Starting at `[0, 0]`, ending at `[0.068, 0]`. * `line_2`: Starting at `[0.068, 0]`, ending at `[0.068, 0.1214]`. * `line_3`: Starting at `[0.068, 0.1214]`, ending at `[0, 0.1214]`. * `line_4`: Starting at `[0, 0.1214]`, ending at `[0, 0]`. 4. **Scale the 2D sketch** horizontally by the factor specified in `sketch_scale` (0.1214). This will adjust the size of the sketch proportionally. 5. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** using the Euler Angles and Translation Vector from the `coordinate_system`. This transition will enable you to work in 3D space using the same 2D sketch elements. 6. **Extrude the 2D sketch** as a 3D model along the Z-axis. Set the `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.4971) to define the height of the prism. The extrusion can extend in the opposite direction of the normal, thus set `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0) to avoid any undesired extensions. You have now created the first part of the CAD assembly - a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, parallel sides with the top and bottom faces being perpendicular to them, and a sloped side at 45 degrees. The dimensions of the part are 0.4971 x 0.1214 x 0.1214 (L x W x H). Continue this process for additional parts in the CAD assembly JSON, following the pattern I provided in this response. Make sure to note that in some CAD applications the height of the extrusion will be oriented along the Y-axis, while in others it would still be the Z-axis, make sure to adjust accordingly to obtain the desired shape.</description>",
