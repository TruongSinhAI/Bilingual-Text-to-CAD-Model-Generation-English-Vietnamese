The description's title of \\\"Triangular Cutout\\\" is incorrect based on the circular loops.\\n\\n-Check Extrusion Parameters:\\n--Extrude depth `0.007` matches. `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is correctly inferred as `0.0`.\\n--Sketch scale `0.75` matches.\\n--Operation `NewBodyFeatureOperation` is consistent with \\\"creating a 3D Solid\\\".\\n\\n-Correction: The primary inconsistency is the descriptive title of the part, which refers to a \\\"Triangular Cutout\\\" while the actual sketch details and JSON show rectangular and circular features. Although the detailed instructions for creating the sketch elements and extrusion parameters match the JSON, the overall part description (title) is inaccurate, leading to a 'No' validation.\\n</think>"

Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0682]. Step 2: Draw the first face (face_1) of the rectangular prism Create the first face (face_1) of the rectangular prism using the following lines to form two loops (loop_1 and loop_2): Loop 1 (loop_1) 1. Draw line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] 2. Draw line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.4773] 3. Draw line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.4773], End Point [0.0, 0.4773] 4.

Step 4: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by 0.0085 units and in the opposite direction by 0 units.
