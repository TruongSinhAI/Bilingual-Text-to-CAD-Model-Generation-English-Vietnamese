The object is centered in the image. 1. **Create a new coordinate system:** The euler angles are [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 2. **Draw the 2D sketch:** The sketch will be drawn on a plane defined by the coordinate system. It contains one face (face\\\\_1) with one loop (loop\\\\_1). 3. **Draw the loop (loop\\\\_1) in face\\\\_1:** Starting at the point [0.0, 0.0222], draw an arc (arc\\\\_1) ending at [0.0222, 0.0]. This arc has a mid point at [0.0065, 0.0065]. Next, draw a line (line\\\\_1) from the endpoint of arc\\\\_1 to [0.7278, 0.0]. Then, draw an arc (arc\\\\_2) from the endpoint of line\\\\_1 to [0.75, 0.0222]. This arc has a mid point at [0.7435, 0.0065]. After that, draw a line (line\\\\_2) from the endpoint of arc\\\\_2 to [0.75, 0.45]. Then, draw an arc (arc\\\\_3) from the endpoint of line\\\\_2 to [0.7278, 0.4722]. This arc has a mid point at [0.7435, 0.4657]. Now, draw a line (line\\\\_3) from the endpoint of arc\\\\_3 to [0.0222, 0.4722]. Lastly, draw an arc (arc\\\\_4) from the endpoint of line\\\\_3 to [0.0, 0.45]. This arc has a mid point at [0.0065, 0.4657]. Finally, draw a line (line\\\\_4) from the endpoint of arc\\\\_4 to the starting point of arc\\\\_1. Note that there are a total of 4 lines and 4 arcs in this loop. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch:** Scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter sketch\\\\_scale = 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model:** Extrude the sketch using an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.0222 and an extrusion depth opposite the normal of 0.0. The resulting 3D model has a length of 0.75, width of 0.75, and height of 0.0222. This completes the construction of Part 1.</description>",
