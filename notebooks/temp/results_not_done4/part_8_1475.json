The length and width of this part are both 0.4069 units, and the height is 0.75 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.4069. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the given coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use an extrude depth towards the normal of 0.75 units and an extrude depth opposite the normal of 0 units. The sketch scaling factor is 0.4069.
