    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Metallic Object with Curved Handle and Rectangular Base** The first part is a metallic object with a curved handle and a rectangular base that is wider than the handle. The object is symmetrical along the vertical axis, has a cylindrical shape with a hollow center, and the handle is slightly curved with a hole in the center. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translation vector `[0.0, 0.0529, 0.0]`. **Sketch Face 1:** 1. Draw the first line from `[0.0, 0.0]` to `[0.0881, 0.0]`. 2. Create an arc with the start point at `[0.0881, 0.0]`, midpoint at `[0.3526, 0.1906]`, and end point at `[0.617, 0.0]`. 3. Draw the second line from `[0.617, 0.0]` to `[0.7052, 0.0]`. 4. Draw the third line from `[0.7052, 0.0]` to `[0.5289, 0.617]`. 5.

The loop consists of 4 lines and 2 arcs. **Sketch Face 1, Loop 2:** Create a circle with the center at `[0.3526, 0.5667]` and radius `0.1763`. **Extrusion Parameters:** Once you have drawn the 2D sketch, scale it using a scaling factor of `0.75`. Use the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system to transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of `0.0529` in the direction of the normal, and `0.0` in the opposite direction. The sketch scale is `0.75`. The boolean operation for this part is a \"New Body\" operation. The dimensions of the part are: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.0529 * Height: 0.75 Now, continue with the subsequent parts and their respective instructions as per the CAD Assembly JSON. Follow the same format for each part, starting with the shape being constructed and proceeding with detailed step-by-step instructions.</description>",
