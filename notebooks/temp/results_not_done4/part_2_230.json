    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with Cylindrical Hole** The first part is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat top and bottom. The cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The prism is slightly tapered towards the top. **Creating the coordinate system:** Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the location (0, 0.0577, 0) with Euler angles (0, 0, -90). This will be the reference frame for constructing the part. **Creating the 2D sketch:** Create a new 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. This sketch consists of three loops: loop_1, loop_2, and loop_3. They form the outer rectangle and two inner circles at the ends of the cylindrical hole. *Loop 1 (outer rectangle):* 1. Draw line_1 from (0.0865, 0) to (0.375, 0). 2. Draw line_2 from (0.375, 0) to (0.6635, 0). 3. Draw arc_1 from (0.6635, 0) to (0.6635, 0.1731) with midpoint at (0.75, 0.0865). 4. Draw line_3 from (0.6635, 0.1731) to (0.375, 0.1731). 5. Draw line_4 from (0.375, 0.1731) to (0.0865, 0.1731). 6. Draw arc_2 from (0.0865, 0.1731) to (0.0865, 0) with midpoint at (0, 0.0865). *Loop 2 (left cylindrical hole):* 1. Draw circle_1 centered at (0.0865, 0.0865) with radius 0.0404. *Loop 3 (right cylindrical hole):* 1. Draw circle_1 centered at (0.6635, 0.0865) with radius 0.0404. **Constraints for the sketch:** 1. All lines and arcs should form closed loops. 2. There should be no gaps or overlaps between lines, arcs, and circles. 3. Align the circles' centers with the endpoints of the rectangle's corresponding edges. 4. Ensure symmetry across the centerline. **Creating the 3D solid:** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 in all directions. Then, transform this scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given coordinate system information: rotation about Z-axis (-90°) and translation along the Z-axis (0). Extrude the 3D sketch along the normal vector by 0.0577 units to create the desired rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole. The height of this part is the same as the extrusion depth, i.e., 0.0577 units.</description>",

The loop is closed.\\n--Extrusion: Depths and scale match. \"\n      ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n      ,\" is correct for the base body.\\n\\n-Part 2 (Cylindrical Hole):\\n--Coordinate system: Values match the description and JSON.\\n--Sketch loop_1: Lines are correctly defined.

Therefore, the description is incomplete and does not fully match the JSON content.\\n</think>"
