The front face is angled at 45 degrees. This is the shape of part 1, and its dimensions are as follows: * Length: 0.2375 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.2375 After the sketch is complete, scale it by a factor of 0.2375. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to generate the 3D model for part 1 with the following parameters: * Extrusion Depth Towards Normal: 0.0 * Extrusion Depth Opposite Normal: 0.75 * Sketch Scale: 0.2375 * Boolean Operation: Create a new solid body.
