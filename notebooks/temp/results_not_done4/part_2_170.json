A cut operation subtracts material, fundamentally contradicting the \"       , \"construct\"       , \" instruction.\\n\\n- Correction: The description is incomplete regarding extrusion parameters and sketch scales for both parts. The functional intent of \"       , \"Part 2\"       , \" (construction vs. cutting) is contradictory between the description and the JSON's operation type. To match, the description would need to explicitly include all extrusion parameters and clarify the exact operation for Part 2 (e.g., if it's cutting a hole in Part 1).\\n</think>"
