Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. Step 3: Draw the curves for the sketch * Draw line 1 from point [0.0, 0.6495] to point [0.375, 0.0]. * Draw line 2 from point [0.375, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.6495]. * Draw line 3 from point [0.75, 0.6495] to point [0.0, 0.6495]. These lines form a closed loop. Step 4: Constrain the loops and curves of the sketch None of the curves require any specific constraints. Step 5: Scale the sketch using the sketch scaling parameter Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Step 6: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Step 7: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch by a distance of 0.2083 towards the positive normal direction and a distance of 0.0 towards the negative normal direction.

Final shape: Three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center The final shape is the combination of Part 1 and Part 2. The rectangular prism is joined with the cylindrical hole, resulting in a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The dimensions of the prism are 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.2083, and the cylindrical hole has a diameter of 0.25 and a depth of 0.2083. The height, width, and length of the final shape are the same as those of Part 1.</description>",
