Scale the sketch using the sketch_scale parameter, which is 0.75. 2. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system. 3. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.0735, and there is no extrusion in the opposite direction of normals. The part is integrated with preceding CAD models based on the NewBodyFeatureOperation; this adds material and forms a new body.
