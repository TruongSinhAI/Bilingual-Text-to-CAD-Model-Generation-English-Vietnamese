Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 2. Set the Euler Angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector to [0.375, 0.0484, 0.1125]. Next, create a new sketch for part 2.

On face 2, create a loop consisting of an arc and two lines. Set the start point of the arc to [0.2016, 0.2625], the midpoint to [0.1662, 0.3479], and the endpoint to [0.2516, 0.3125].

Set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.375, the extrude depth opposite the normal to 0.0, and the sketch scale to 0.4031. The operation for this part is to join the current part with the previous parts. The final shape of the CAD assembly is a cylindrical object with a tapered top and two parallel flanges at the bottom.

Step 2: Draw the Sketch on the X-Y Plane Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Face 1: For this face, create two nested loops: loop_1 and loop_2. Loop 1: * Create line_1 with a start point of [0.0, 0.0] and an end point of [0.75, 0.0]. * Create line_2 with a start point of [0.75, 0.0] and an end point of [0.75, 0.4641]. * Create line_3 with a start point of [0.75, 0.4641] and an end point of [0.0, 0.4641]. * Create line_4 with a start point of [0.0, 0.4641] and an end point of [0.0, 0.0]. Loop 2: * Create line_1 with a start point of [0.4901, 0.0371] and an end point of [0.7129, 0.0371]. * Create line_2 with a start point of [0.7129, 0.0371] and an end point of [0.7129, 0.2599]. * Create line_3 with a start point of [0.7129, 0.2599] and an end point of [0.4901, 0.2599]. * Create line_4 with a start point of [0.4901, 0.2599] and an end point of [0.4901, 0.0371]. Step 3: Scale the 2D Sketch Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch. Step 4: Transform the Sketch into a 3D Sketch and Extrude Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Then, extrude the sketch along the normal with an extrusion depth of 0.0056 units towards the normal, and no extrusion in the opposite direction. Step 5: Describe the Part This part has the following dimensions: * Shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one of its faces. * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.0056 units * Height: 0.75 units Step 6: Perform the Operation to Combine the Parts (Describe the boolean operation of the current part with the previous part) This part is created as a new body. Combine this new part with the previous parts as required by performing a boolean operation, either joining, cutting, or intersecting the parts. Ensure that the final shape matches the desired final shape: \"A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one of its faces.\"</description>",
