Create a line (line_1) starting at point [0.0, 0.0] and ending at point [0.525, 0.0]. b. Create a line (line_2) starting at point [0.525, 0.0] and ending at point [0.525, 0.75]. c.

Create a line (line_4) starting at point [0.0, 0.75] and ending at point [0.0, 0.0] to close the loop. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch:** Apply the scaling factor of 0.75 to the 2D sketch. This will reduce the size of the sketch. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch:** Reorient the scaled 2D sketch in the 3D workspace using the euler angles and the translation vector specified in the coordinate system. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch:** Set the extrusion depth toward the normal as 0.2062 and the depth opposite normal as 0.0. Use the scaled_sketch_parameter (0.75) for uniform scaling during extrusion. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction creating the 3D prism with a flat top and bottom.

Extrude the scaled sketch by 0.204 units in the positive Z-direction using the extrusion depth towards the normal. The height of the resulting prism is approximately 0.204 units.
