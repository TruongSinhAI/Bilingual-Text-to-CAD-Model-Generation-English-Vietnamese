Next, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch should consist of a single face (face\\\\_1), which can be divided into 4 lines. Start by drawing a line (line\\\\_1) from [0.0, 0.0] to [0.0156, 0.0]. Then draw a line (line\\\\_2) from [0.0156, 0.0] to [0.0156, 0.12]. Follow this by a line (line\\\\_3) from [0.0156, 0.12] to [0.0, 0.12], and finally a line (line\\\\_4) from [0.0, 0.12] to [0.0, 0.0]. This completes the sketch, which is a rectangle with a width of 0.12 units and a length of approximately 0.12 units. After this, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.12. This scales the sketch so that the width of the prism is 0.75 units and the length of the prism is approximately 0.12 units. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. The euler angles for this transformation should be the same as for the coordinate system, but the translation vector should be set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] to ensure the sketch is transformed to the correct location in the coordinate system. Now, extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.75 units. The result of these steps will be a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, with a width of 0.75 units and a length of approximately 0.12 units. The height of the prism is 0.75 units, as specified in the operation. The final step is to join this newly created part with any existing bodies. In this case, the prism is being created from scratch, so no join operation is necessary. However, in future instructions, there may be a need to perform a join operation with existing bodies to combine the parts into a single solid model.
