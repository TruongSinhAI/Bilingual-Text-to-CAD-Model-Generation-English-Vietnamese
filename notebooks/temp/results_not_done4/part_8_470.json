This part will be constructed using a series of lines to create the base sketch, which will then be extruded to form the 3D model. **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1.

This sketch will serve as the base for the 3D model. **Step 3: Draw the first line** Draw the first line of the sketch by specifying the start point as [0.0, 0.0] and the end point as [0.0312, 0.0]. This line will form the left edge of the rectangular prism. **Step 4: Draw the second line** Draw the second line of the sketch by specifying the start point as [0.0312, 0.0] and the end point as [0.0312, 0.0039]. This line will form the bottom edge of the prism. **Step 5: Draw the third line** Draw the third line of the sketch by specifying the start point as [0.0312, 0.0039] and the end point as [0.0039, 0.0039]. This line will form the right edge of the prism. **Step 6: Draw the fourth line** Draw the fourth line of the sketch by specifying the start point as [0.0039, 0.0039] and the end point as [0.0039, 0.0312].

This line will form the back edge of the prism, closing the loop and completing the sketch. **Step 9: Scale the sketch** Scale the sketch using a scaling factor of 0.0312. This will ensure that the final 3D model has the correct dimensions. **Step 10: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Use the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system to transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. **Step 11: Extrude the 3D sketch** Extrude the 3D sketch by a depth of 0.75 units in the normal direction. This will create the final cad model for part 1. The length of this part is 0.0312 units, the width is 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0312 units.</description>",

Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system Create a new sketch on the XY plane defined by the coordinate system and draw two circles (face_1 loop_1 circle_1 and face_1 loop_2 circle_1) and one circle (face_2 loop_1 circle_1) with the provided centers and radii.
