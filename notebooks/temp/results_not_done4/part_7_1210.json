    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. For this part, set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. Create the 2D sketch for this part on face 1 of the coordinate system. The sketch contains one loop (loop_1) with four straight lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4). The lines form a rectangle as shown below: 1. Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.5, 0.0] 2. Line 2: Start Point [0.5, 0.0], End Point [0.5, 0.5] 3. Line 3: Start Point [0.5, 0.5], End Point [0.0, 0.5] 4. Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.5], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the coordinate system's properties. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model of this part. Set the extrude depth towards the normal to 0.5 and the extrude depth opposite the normal to 0.0. Use the NewBodyFeatureOperation to complete this part. The height of this part is 0.5, the width is 0.5, and the length is 0.5, giving the part a 2:3:4 ratio. **Part 2: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, smaller than part 1** Create a new coordinate system for this part with the same Euler angles as part 1 but with a different translation vector set to [0.0, 0.25, 0.0]. For this part, create the 2D sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system. The sketch contains one loop (loop_1) with four straight lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4), forming a rectangle, similar to Part 1: 1. Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.25, 0.0] 2. Line 2: Start Point [0.25, 0.0], End Point [0.25, 0.25] 3. Line 3: Start Point [0.25, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.25] 4. Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.25], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Scale the 2D sketch with a scaling parameter of 0.25. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the coordinate system's properties. Extrude the 2D sketch with a depth toward the normal of 0.25 and no extrusion in the opposite direction of the normals. Use the JoinFeatureOperation to join this part with Part 1. The dimensions of this part are 0.25 in height, 0.25 in width, and 0.25 in length, making it slightly smaller than Part 1. Final Model: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with tapered top and bottom After completing all parts and operations, you will have a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the front and back faces are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The sides are straight and meet at right angles. The dimensions approximately follow a 2:3:4 ratio in length, width, and height.</description>",
