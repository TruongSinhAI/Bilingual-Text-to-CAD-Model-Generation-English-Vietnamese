    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism** The first part of the CAD assembly is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel, and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal, with the height being half the length of the sides. **Step 1: Create a coordinate system** For the coordinate system, set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees, and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 2: Draw the first 2D sketch** First, create a new sketch on the XY plane. Use the following line segments to form two squares, one inside the other. * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.75] * Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] **Step 3: Draw the second 2D sketch** Create a new sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system (rotate and translate if necessary). Use the following line segments to form a smaller square inside the larger square: * Line 1: Start Point [0.3233, 0.1977], End Point [0.5784, 0.1977] * Line 2: Start Point [0.5784, 0.1977], End Point [0.5784, 0.3421] * Line 3: Start Point [0.5784, 0.3421], End Point [0.3233, 0.3421] * Line 4: Start Point [0.3233, 0.3421], End Point [0.3233, 0.1977] **Step 4: Scale and transform the 2D sketches** Scale the first sketch with a scaling factor of 0.75 and the second sketch with a scaling factor of 1 (no scaling). Transform them using the coordinate system defined before. **Step 5: Extrude the 2D sketches** Extrude the first sketch by 0.75 units towards the normal and the second sketch by the same distance in the opposite direction. This will create our three-dimensional rectangular prism. Set 'sketch_scale' to 0.75 and select the 'NewBodyFeatureOperation' as the boolean operation. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with the following dimensions: * length: 0.75 units * width: 0.75 units * height: 0.75 units</description>",
