    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top and Bottom** The first part of the CAD model is a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, while the front and back faces are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The sides of the prism are straight and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height. **Step 1: Create the Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. The euler angles for this coordinate system are 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 degrees, and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. **Step 2: Draw the Sketch** Next, draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the newly created coordinate system. The sketch will consist of a single face (face\\\\_1). Face\\\\_1 will contain a single loop (loop\\\\_1) with six lines (line\\\\_1 through line\\\\_6). - line\\\\_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.4687, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point = [0.4687, 0.0], End Point = [0.4687, 0.4687] - line\\\\_3: Start Point = [0.4687, 0.4687], End Point = [0.2812, 0.4687] - line\\\\_4: Start Point = [0.2812, 0.4687], End Point = [0.2812, 0.1875] - line\\\\_5: Start Point = [0.2812, 0.1875], End Point = [0.0, 0.1875] - line\\\\_6: Start Point = [0.0, 0.1875], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] **Step 3: Scale the Sketch** Scale the sketched shape by a factor of 0.4687. This scaling operation is applied to the entire sketch. **Step 4: Extrude the Sketch into a 3D Model** Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.75 units (towards the positive Z direction) to create the 3D model. The `operation` for this part is `NewBodyFeatureOperation`.</description>",
