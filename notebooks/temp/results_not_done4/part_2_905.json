Now, we'll proceed with scaling and extrusion. Scaling and Transformation Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the `sketch_scale` parameter. Then, using the `euler_angles` and `translation_vector` provided by the `coordinate_system` in the JSON, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch. Extrusion Extrude the 2D sketch to a depth of 0.1042 towards the normal direction for creating the 3D model. There is no extrusion in the opposite direction of the normals as given in `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`. Describing the operation naturally: This operation will create a new solid body by adding material to a flat 2D sketch. Dimensions The height of the part is 0.1042 units (from the `height` field in the JSON). The length and width, both being 0.75 units, are determined by the dimensions of the 2D sketch in the X-Y plane. The final shape, a long rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, has its sides parallel and meeting at right angles. It is centered in the image, as provided in the JSON. The CAD model for this part is now complete, and the resulting shape matches the description provided in the `description` field of the JSON. The next part will be constructed similarly following the sequence - 2D Sketch, Scaling and Transformation, Extrusion, and describing its shape and dimensions.</description>",
