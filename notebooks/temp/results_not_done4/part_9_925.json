Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by `0.0714` units to create the 3D model. 2. The operation for this part is to create a new body. This completes the first part of the CAD assembly. The resulting 3D model has the following dimensions: - Length: 0.0714 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.75 units The model of the rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center has been created, and we can proceed to the next part of the assembly if applicable.</description>",

The final shape of the assembly is a rectangular prism with a curved top and flat bottom, and rounded top and bottom edges. The sides are straight, and the model is symmetrical along the central axis. The length, width, and height of the final shape are 0.3125, 0.3125, and 0.1943 respectively.</description>",
