Matches JSON.\\n- Part 2 Extrusion: Extruded by 0.15 in the opposite normal direction, with a cut operation. This creates a rectangular slot/cut. Matches JSON.\\n- Part 3 Sketch: A circle with radius 0.1 (diameter 0.2). Matches JSON.\\n- Part 3 Extrusion: Extruded by 1.25 in the opposite normal direction, with a cut operation. This creates a cylindrical hole. Matches JSON.\\n- Coordinate Systems: All translation vectors and Euler angles are correct as per description.\\n- Consistency: The operations imply a base body (part 1) from which cuts (part 2 and part 3) are made. This logical flow is consistent with CAD modeling.\\n\\n- Correction: This inferred data is accurate and does not require further modifications.\\n</think>"
