Part 2: Construction of a Tapered Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism Step 1: Creation of Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.022, 0.5596, 0.0146] Step 2: Drawing the 2D Sketch Draw a rectangle on the X-Y plane of the newly created coordinate system with the following vertices: - Point 1: (0.0, 0.0) - Point 2: (0.1414, 0.0) - Point 3: (0.1414, 0.1685) - Point 4: (0.0, 0.1685) Step 3: Scaling the Sketch Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.1685. Step 4: Extrusion of the Sketch Extrude the sketch along its normal direction by 0.2388 units and in the opposite direction by 0 units. Final Step: Combining the Parts Combine the two parts as described in the JSON instructions (using JoinFeatureOperation).\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts:\\n-part_1: (Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism)\\n--coordinate_system:\\n---Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description).\\n---Translation Vector: [0.022, 0.022, 0.0] (Derived from description).\\n--sketch:\\n---face_1:\\n----loop_1: (Rectangle)\\n-----line_1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.5164, 0.0) (Derived from description).\\n-----line_2: (0.5164, 0.0) to (0.5164, 0.7061) (Derived from description).\\n-----line_3: (0.5164, 0.7061) to (0.0, 0.7061) (Derived from description).\\n-----line_4: (0.0, 0.7061) to (0.0, 0.0) (Derived from description).\\n--extrusion:\\n---extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0146 (Derived from description).\\n---extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Derived from description).\\n---sketch_scale: 0.7061 (Derived from description).\\n---operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (Inferred as it's the first part and creates a body).\\n\\n-part_2: (Tapered Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism)\\n--coordinate_system:\\n---Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description).\\n---Translation Vector: [0.022, 0.5596, 0.0146] (Derived from description).\\n--sketch:\\n---face_1:\\n----loop_1: (Rectangle)\\n-----line_1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.1414, 0.0) (Derived from description).\\n-----line_2: (0.1414, 0.0) to (0.1414, 0.1685) (Derived from description).\\n-----line_3: (0.1414, 0.1685) to (0.0, 0.1685) (Derived from description).\\n-----line_4: (0.0, 0.1685) to (0.0, 0.0) (Derived from description).\\n--extrusion:\\n---extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.2388 (Derived from description).\\n---extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Derived from description).\\n---sketch_scale: 0.1685 (Derived from description).\\n---operation: \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" (Explicitly stated in \\\"Final Step: Combining the Parts ... using JoinFeatureOperation\\\").\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Part 1 validation:\\n--Coordinate system parameters, sketch points, extrusion depths, and sketch scale all match the JSON exactly.
