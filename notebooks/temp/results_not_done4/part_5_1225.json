    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation and no translation. This will be the basis for our CAD model. **Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch** Next, create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. In this sketch, we will draw the profile of the rectangular prism. **Step 3: Draw the first arc** Draw the first arc starting at the point (0, 0.1973) with a midpoint at (0.1766, 0.052) and ending at the point (0.3993, 0.0). **Step 4: Draw the first line** Draw the first line starting at the point (0.3993, 0.0) and ending at the point (0.75, 0.0). **Step 5: Draw the second line** Draw the second line starting at the point (0.75, 0.0) and ending at the point (0.75, 0.2309). **Step 6: Draw the third line** Draw the third line starting at the point (0.75, 0.2309) and ending at the point (0.0, 0.2309). **Step 7: Draw the fourth line** Draw the fourth line starting at the point (0.0, 0.2309) and ending at the point (0.0, 0.1973). **Step 8: Close the Loop** Close the loop by connecting the last endpoint to the first starting point. This will create a closed loop with five curves: one arc and four lines. **Step 9: Scale the Sketch** Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75 to adjust the dimensions of the rectangular prism. **Step 10: Transform the Sketch into 3D** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by defining the euler angles (0, 0, 0) and translation vector (0, 0, 0) to maintain the sketch in the X-Y plane, with no rotation or translation. **Step 11: Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the 3D sketch by a depth of 0.1443 towards the positive Z direction, creating the rectangular prism. **Step 12: Finalize the First Part** The first part of the CAD model is now complete, consisting of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, parallel sides, and perpendicular top and bottom faces. The height of the prism is approximately three times the width of the base.</description>",
