    "prompt": "<description>**Instructions to Create the Final Shape** The final shape is a 3D model of a square with a central hole, resembling a stylized letter 'H'. The model is symmetrical and has a flat bottom. The hole is rectangular and is located at the center of the square. The model is simple and does not contain any additional details or features. **Part 1** Create the base of the model by following these steps: **Coordinate System** Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0072, 0.3173, 0.0]. This will position the coordinate system for the base of the model. **Sketch** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of two loops, loop 1 and loop 2. **Loop 1** Loop 1 consists of four lines: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.1154, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.1154, 0.0], End Point [0.1154, 0.1154] * Line 3: Start Point [0.1154, 0.1154], End Point [0.0, 0.1154] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.1154], End Point [0.0, 0.0] **Loop 2** Loop 2 consists of four lines: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0144, 0.0144], End Point [0.101, 0.0144] * Line 2: Start Point [0.101, 0.0144], End Point [0.101, 0.101] * Line 3: Start Point [0.101, 0.101], End Point [0.0144, 0.101] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0144, 0.101], End Point [0.0144, 0.0144] **Extrusion** Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.1154. Extrude the sketch by 0.0577 units towards the normal direction and 0 units in the opposite direction. This will create the base of the model with the specified height, width, and length. **Completion** With the completion of the extrusion, the part is ready. The first part created has a shape of a square with a central hole, a height of 0.0577 units, a width of 0.1154 units, and a length of 0.1154 units. This completes the construction of Part 1. Repeat the steps for the remaining parts with similar instructions. Specify any additional adjustments regarding each part's dimensions or shape as needed. Remember to describe the curves, loops, and faces, as well as provide the height, width, and length for each part and the final shape. Be concise and avoid specific boolean operation terms in the instructions. Start each part's instructions by stating the shape being constructed and provide only the necessary steps for its creation.</description>",

The difference (0.1154 - 0.0144 * 2) = 0.1154 - 0.0288 = 0.0866, which means the hole is centered (0.0144 offset from each side). The width/height of the outer square is 0.1154, and the inner square is (0.101-0.0144) = 0.0866.

The start/end points of sequential curves connect correctly: (0,0)->(0.4568,0)->(0.4568,0.1349)->(0.062,0.1349) and then the arc from (0.062,0.1349) back to (0,0). This is a valid closed contour. -face_2.loop_1: Lines and arc form a closed loop. The connections are: (0,0.2697) via arc to (0.062,0.1349), then to (0.4568,0.1349), then to (0.4568,0.2697), then back to (0,0.2697). This is a valid closed contour. -The presence of two separate faces in the sketch for Part 1 is consistent with the description specifying \\\"Draw the first face...\\\" and \\\"Draw the second face...\\\". -Part 2 sketch: -face_1.loop_1 (outer circle) and face_1.loop_2 (inner circle) are concentric and define a hollow circular profile. -face_2.loop_1 (inner circle) is identical to face_1.loop_2. This redundancy or specific interpretation of \\\"Draw the second face of the cylindrical object\\\" is accurately reflected in the JSON structure, even if it's an unusual CAD modeling practice for a single hollow cylinder. The description explicitly states to \\\"Draw the second face of the cylindrical object\\\" by drawing *a* circle, and the JSON creates a separate `face_2` for this. -Part 3 sketch: -face_1.loop_1: Lines form a closed loop. (0,0)->(0.375,0)->(0.375,0.1645)->(0,0.1645)->(0,0). This is a valid closed rectangular loop. -Extrusions: -All extrusion depths (towards and opposite normal) and sketch scales match the described values or are correctly inferred (0.0 when not specified for a direction). -Operations: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\", \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\", \\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\" are consistent with the \\\"Combine the three parts\\\" instruction at the end of the description. -Correction: The inferred data accurately reflects the provided description and the JSON structure. No corrections are necessary. </think>"
