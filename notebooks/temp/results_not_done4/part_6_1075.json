This correctly forms an axis-aligned rectangle. The line definitions match the JSON.\\n  - The description explicitly states \"\n    ,\"Create a circular arc that connects the following points: [0.375, 0.0], [0.375, 0.375], [0.0, 0.375]\"\n    ,\".

Start by defining a new coordinate system with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0], and translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.1244]. For the sketch, use face\\\\_1 and create loop\\\\_1. Start with line\\\\_1 from [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0]; follow it with line\\\\_2 from [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0006], arc\\\\_1 from [0.75, 0.0006] to [0.625, 0.1256], line\\\\_3 from [0.625, 0.1256] to [0.5, 0.1256], arc\\\\_2 from [0.5, 0.1256] to [0.0, 0.1256]; then close the loop with line\\\\_4 from [0.0, 0.1256] to [0.0, 0.0]. Extrude the sketch using a depth of 0.0 towards the normal, 0.5 opposite the normal, and a scaling parameter of 0.75. This is a \"\n    ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n    ,\". Part 3 Form a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom, approximately three times its diameter, with a slightly wider top than bottom. Begin with a new coordinate system with euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0], translation vector [0.1095, 0.25, 0.125]. For the sketch, focus on face\\\\_1 and create loop\\\\_1. Within loop\\\\_1, define circle\\\\_1 centered at [0.125, 0.125] with a radius of 0.125. Extrude the sketch using a depth of 0.0 towards the normal and 0.3125 opposite the normal, with a scaling parameter of 0.25.
