Create 2D sketch on the XY plane with the below components: * Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.3449, 0.0] * Line 2: [0.3449, 0.0] to [0.3449, 0.332] * Line 3: [0.3449, 0.332] to [0.0, 0.332] * Line 4: [0.0, 0.332] to [0.0, 0.0] The loop is closed and has 4 lines in sequence. Generate 3D Sketch 1. Scale the 2D sketch using the given scaling parameter: * Sketch_scale: 0.3449 2. Transform the 2D sketch to 3D using euler angles and the translation vector. Update the information accordingly: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.3334, 0.0] units Extrude Sketch 1.
