Now, create the 2D sketch on the XY plane defined by the coordinate system. Sketch a circle on the XY plane, with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. This will create a single loop with a single circle on face 1 of the sketch. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch, by applying the coordinate system parameters. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.0938 towards the normal direction, and a depth of 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal. This will create a slightly tapered cylindrical shape with a flat top and bottom. The height of this intermediate part is 0.0938, and the width and length are both 0.75. This concludes the instructions for this intermediate part.

Now, create the 2D sketch on the XY plane defined by the coordinate system. Sketch a rectangle on the XY plane, with opposite corners at (0, 0) and (1, 1). This will create a single face with a single loop that contains four lines. Add four arcs to the loop, each with a radius of 0.1 and a center at the midpoint of each line segment. This will create rounded corners on the rectangle. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.8. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch, by applying the coordinate system parameters. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.1 in the normal direction, and a depth of 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal. This will create a rectangular shape with rounded corners. The height of this intermediate part is 0.1, and the width and length are both 0.8. This concludes the instructions for this intermediate part.

This will create a single loop with a single circle. On face 2, sketch a rectangle with opposite corners at (0, 0.125) and (0.875, 0.25). This will create a single loop with four lines. Add four arcs to the loop on face 2, each with a radius of 0.1 and a center at the midpoint of each line segment. This will create rounded corners on the rectangle. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch, by applying the coordinate system parameters. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.0938 towards the normal direction, and a depth of 0.0 in the opposite direction of the normal. This will create a slightly tapered cylindrical shape with a flat top and bottom. On the same 3D sketch, extrude the rectangle on face 2 by a depth of 0.1 in the normal direction, and a depth of 0</description>",
