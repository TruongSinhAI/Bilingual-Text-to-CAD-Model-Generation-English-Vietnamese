The shape is a long, thin, cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. 2. The length and width are both 0.75 units. 3. The height is 0.0147 units. Explanation: First, create a new coordinate system with no rotation and a translation vector of (0,0,0). Then, create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane and draw four lines that form a rectangle. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75, then transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the sketch by 0.0147 units, resulting in a long, thin, cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. Document the resulting part's shape, dimensions, and other relevant details.</description>",
