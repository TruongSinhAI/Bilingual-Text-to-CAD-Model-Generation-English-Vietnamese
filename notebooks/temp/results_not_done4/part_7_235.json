We will use the following steps to construct this part: 1. Create a new coordinate system based on the Euler angles and translation vector provided. 2. Develop three faces, each with a distinct loop. 3. Create sketches and define loops for each face. 4. Extrude the sketches into a 3D model. **Step 1: Create a new coordinate system** Create a new coordinate system using the following Euler angles and translation vector: - Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] **Step 2: Develop three faces** Face 1: This face consists of one loop (loop_1) with 7 lines and 1 arc, forming a curved side and the tapered end. Face 2: This face consists of one loop (loop_1) with 5 lines, forming the bottom flat surface. Face 3: This face consists of one loop (loop_1) with 5 lines, forming the top flat surface. **Step 3: Create sketches and define loops for each face** Face 1: - Sketch a shape with loop_1 including arc_1 and 6 lines. Face 2: - Sketch a shape with loop_1 including 5 lines. Face 3: - Sketch a shape with loop_1 including 5 lines. **Step 4: Extrude the sketches into a 3D model** Extrude each face using the \"sketch_scale\" parameter (0.0327) provided in the JSON: - Extrude Face 1's loop_1 sketch by a depth of 0.75 towards the normal. - Extrude Face 2's loop_1 sketch by a depth of 0.0 towards the opposite normal. - Extrude Face 3's loop_1 sketch by a depth of 0.0 towards the opposite normal. The resulting part should match the part_1 description in the JSON: - Shape: A long, thin, rectangular object with a flat top and bottom.
