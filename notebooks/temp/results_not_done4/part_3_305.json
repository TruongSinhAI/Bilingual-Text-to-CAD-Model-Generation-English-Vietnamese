This part will result in a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole at the center and a flat top and bottom. The dimensions of this prism are approximately `0.57` units in length, `0.75` units in width, and `0.57` units in height. The cylindrical hole will share the width dimension of the part. Once this part is complete, continue with the following parts and operations as required by the assembly sequence. Upon completing the instructions and creating the required CAD model, the resulting shape should match the provided description in the JSON data.</description>",
