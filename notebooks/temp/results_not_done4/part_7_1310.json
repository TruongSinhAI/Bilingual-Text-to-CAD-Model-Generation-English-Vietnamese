The prism has a length of 2 units, a width of 1 unit, and a height of 0.5 units. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [-90°, 0°, -90°] * Translation Vector: [0.0145, 0, 0] Step 2: Draw the first face of the prism Create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw the first face (face\\_1) as a rectangle with the following dimensions and constraints: * Line 1: Start Point [0, 0], End Point [0.75, 0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0], End Point [0.75, 0.2035] * Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.2035], End Point [0, 0.2035] * Line 4: Start Point [0, 0.2035], End Point [0, 0] Step 3: Draw the second face of the prism Draw the second face (loop\\_2) as an offset of the first face, with a constant distance of 0.0035 units. Step 4: Create the 3D model Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.0145 units opposite the normal to create the 3D model. Apply a sketch scale of 0.75 to the sketch before extruding, resulting in an overall height of 0.5 units for the prism. Additional Notes for the Junior CAD Designer: - When creating the coordinate system and sketching, make sure to pay close attention to the specified dimensions and constraints. The prism's shape, length, width, and height are all significant in this design. If necessary, double-check these values against the description provided in the JSON object. - Remember that the second face is an offset of the first face, which forms the outline of the prism's curved side. - Be careful when applying the sketch scale during the extrusion process. The scale value of 0.75 is given explicitly in the instructions. - When extruding, direct the extrusion to be opposite the normal in order to adhere to the specifications, which leads to an overall height of 0.5 units for the prism. - Provide proper annotations and labels to the CAD model after completion, especially the dimensions and height of 0.5 units. This practice adds clarity to the design and makes it easier to be understood by others. By following these guidelines, you should be able to create the desired rectangular prism with a curved side as specified in the given JSON object. There are no additional assumptions to be made in this design process, and the instructions provided should be complete.</description>",
