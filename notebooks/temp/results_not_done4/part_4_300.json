This is a significant omission and makes the description incomplete compared to the JSON.\\n\\n- Sketch Geometry Check for `face_1` (as described):\\n  - The connectivity of `line_1` through `line_12` and `arc_1`, `arc_2` needs to be verified for a closed loop:\\n    - line_1 end [0.3337, 0.0] connects to line_2 start [0.3337, 0.0].\\n    - line_2 end [0.6674, 0.0] connects to line_3 start [0.6674, 0.0].\\n    - line_3 end [0.6674, 0.0849] connects to line_4 start [0.6674, 0.0849].\\n    - line_4 end [0.5708, 0.1815] connects to arc_1 start [0.5708, 0.1815].\\n    - arc_1 end [0.5685, 0.1792] connects to line_5 start [0.5685, 0.1792].\\n    - line_5 end [0.6641, 0.0836] connects to line_6 start [0.6641, 0.0836].\\n    - line_6 end [0.6641, 0.0033] connects to line_7 start [0.6641, 0.0033].\\n    - line_7 end [0.3337, 0.0033] connects to line_8 start [0.3337, 0.0033].\\n    - line_8 end [0.0033, 0.0033] connects to line_9 start [0.0033, 0.0033].\\n    - line_9 end [0.0033, 0.0836] connects to line_10 start [0.0033, 0.0836].\\n    - line_10 end [0.0989, 0.1792] connects to arc_2 start [0.0989, 0.1792].\\n    - arc_2 end [0.0966, 0.1815] connects to line_11 start [0.0966, 0.1815].\\n    - line_11 end [0.0, 0.0849] connects to line_12 start [0.0, 0.0849].\\n    - line_12 end [0.0, 0.0] connects back to line_1 start [0.0, 0.0].\\n    - Result: loop_1 is closed and all points match JSON.\\n\\n- Extrusion Check: Extrusion depths and sketch scale match the JSON.\\n\\n- Correction: The description is incomplete as it does not mention `face_2` and its associated circular loops (`loop_1` and `loop_2`) which are present in the JSON for `part_1`'s sketch.
