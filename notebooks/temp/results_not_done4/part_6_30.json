    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered end Step 1: Create the coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles as [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector as [0.0, 0.75, 0.0]. Step 2: Create the 2D sketch For the first face, create a new loop named `loop_1`. Within this loop, create a circle (`circle_1`) with its center at [0.0189, 0.0189] and radius 0.0189. Create another loop named `loop_2` within the same face. Inside this loop, create another circle (`circle_1`) with the same center but a smaller radius, 0.0094. Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.0377. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the rotation angles and translation vector from the created coordinate system. Step 4: Extrude the 3D sketch Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use the component `extrude_depth_towards_normal` with a value of 0.075 and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` with a value of 0.0. The resulting height of the shape is 0.0377, and the width and length are both 0.075. Part 2: Construct a taller cylindrical object with tapered top and bottom Step 1: Reuse the coordinate system from Part 1 Since the coordinate system in Part 1 applies to this part as well, skip creating a new coordinate system. Step 2: Create the 2D sketch Create a new face. Inside the new face, create a new loop named `loop_1`. Within this loop, create a circle (`circle_1`) with its center at [0.0189, 0.0189] and radius 0.0189. Create another loop named `loop_2` within the same face. Inside this loop, create another circle (`circle_1`) with the same center but a smaller radius, 0.0094. Step 3: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Scale the 2D sketch using the same scaling factor of 0.0377 to ensure compatibility with the part created in step 4. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the rotation angles and translation vector from the created coordinate system. Step 4: Extrude the 3D sketch Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model. Use the component `extrude_depth_towards_normal` with a value of 0.75 and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` with a value of 0.0.
