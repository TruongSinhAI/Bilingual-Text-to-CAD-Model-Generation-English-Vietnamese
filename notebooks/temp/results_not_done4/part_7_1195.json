    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A Long, Thin, Metallic Object with a Pointed End** The first part of the CAD assembly is a long, thin, metallic object with a pointed end. This part consists of a single 2D sketch that is scaled, transformed into 3D, and then extruded to create the final 3D model. **Sketching the 2D Shape** Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with euler angles (0, 0, -90) and a translation vector of (0, 0.0143, 0). Next, create the 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. The 2D shape consists of several lines and arcs, arranged in a specific order to form the desired profile. Begin by creating a line from (0, 0) to (0.0984, 0). Then, create an arc with a start point of (0.0984, 0), a mid point of (0.16, 0.0199), and an end point of (0.2244, 0.0266). Continue the sketch by creating a line from (0.2244, 0.0266) to (0.375, 0.0266). Then, create a line from (0.375, 0.0266) to (0.5256, 0.0266). After that, create an arc with a start point of (0.5256, 0.0266), a mid point of (0.59, 0.0199), and an end point of (0.6516, 0). Next, create a line from (0.6516, 0) to (0.75, 0). Then, create a line from (0.75, 0) to (0.75, 0.0779). After that, create a line from (0.75, 0.0779) to (0.6516, 0.0779). Then, create an arc with a start point of (0.6516, 0.0779), a mid point of (0.59, 0.058), and an end point of (0.5256, 0.0512). Continue the sketch by creating a line from (0.5256, 0.0512) to (0.375, 0.0512). Then, create a line from (0.375, 0.0512) to (0.2244, 0.0512). After that, create an arc with a start point of (0.2244, 0.0512), a mid point of (0.16, 0.058), and an end point of (0.0984, 0.0779). Finally, create a line from (0.0984, 0.0779) to (0, 0.0779) and another line from (0, 0.0779) to (0, 0) to close the loop. **Scaling and Transforming the Sketch** After finishing the sketch, scale it by a factor of 0.75. Then, transform the 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector of the coordinate system. **Extruding the 3D Model** Finally, extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.0072 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is also 0.0072. The resulting part should have a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.0143 units, and a height of 0.75 units, consistent with the final shape description. This completes the instructions for part 1. Proceed with the remaining parts of the CAD assembly, following a similar process for each part. Be sure to adjust the coordinates and dimensions appropriately for each part to create the final CAD model.</description>",
