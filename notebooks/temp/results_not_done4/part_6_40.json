The length and width of this part are 0.0636 units and the height is 0.0179 units. **Final Assembly** The final shape is a cylindrical object with a rectangular hole in the center. The hole is slightly off-center, creating an asymmetrical design. The cylindrical object is a solid, three-dimensional shape with a smooth surface. The rectangular hole is created by the second part which is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners, inserted into the cylindrical object.
