Next, create the 2D sketch for the part on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single face (face_1). Face_1 contains one loop (loop_1), which is made up of the following curves: 1. line_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0] 2. line_2: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0], End Point = [0.75, 0.0625] 3. line_3: Start Point = [0.75, 0.0625], End Point = [0.7109, 0.0625] 4. arc_1: Start Point = [0.7109, 0.0625], Mid Point = [0.622, 0.0254], End Point = [0.5332, 0.0625] 5. line_4: Start Point = [0.5332, 0.0625], End Point = [0.4628, 0.0625] 6. arc_2: Start Point = [0.4628, 0.0625], Mid Point = [0.3724, 0.0238], End Point = [0.2819, 0.0625] 7. line_5: Start Point = [0.2819, 0.0625], End Point = [0.2116, 0.0625] 8. arc_3: Start Point = [0.2116, 0.0625], Mid Point = [0.1253, 0.028], End Point = [0.0391, 0.0625] 9. line_6: Start Point = [0.0391, 0.0625], End Point = [0.0, 0.0625] 10. line_7: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0625], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Loop_1 is a closed loop that consists of lines and arcs. It does not contain any circles. Now, scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by a depth of 0.0078 units and in the opposite normal direction by a depth of 0.0078 units to create the 3D model. The sketch_scale parameter is 0.75 and the boolean operation is \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", which means that the current part is integrated with preceding CAD models to create a new solid body. The dimensions of the final shape are as follows: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.0156 units * Height: 0.75 units The part has a rectangular prism shape with a curved top edge. It is the first intermediate CAD part in the assembly.</description>",
