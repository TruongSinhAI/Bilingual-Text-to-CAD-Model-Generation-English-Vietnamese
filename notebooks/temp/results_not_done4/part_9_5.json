Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Next, create an initial 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. This sketch consists of two faces. *Face 1: Circular hole* 1. Draw a circle with a center at [0.1446, 0.1446] and a radius of 0.1446. *Face 2: Outer boundary of the cylindrical object* 1. Draw a line from the point (0.146, 0.0) to the point (0.611, 0.0044). 2. Draw an arc with a start point at (0.611, 0.0044), a midpoint at (0.75, 0.1446), and an endpoint at (0.611, 0.2849). 3. Draw a line from the point (0.611, 0.2849) to the point (0.146, 0.2893). 4. Draw an arc with a start point at (0.146, 0.2893), a midpoint at (0.2893, 0.1446), and an endpoint at (0.146, 0.0). 5. Create a second loop with a circle centered at (0.6097, 0.1446) and a radius of 0.0795 (same as the circular hole in Face 1). After the 2D sketch is complete, scale it with a factor of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch and extrude it with a depth of 0.1268 in the normal direction. There will be no extrusion in the opposite direction. The final scaling parameter for the sketch is 0.75. The operation to be performed is creating a new solid body. **Intermediate CAD Part 1 Measurements** The length of the outer boundary is 0.75 units. The width of the outer boundary is 0.75 units. The height of the part is 0.1268 units. **Intermediate CAD Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Hollow Center** Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] for the coordinate system. Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. Draw a circle at the center with a radius of 0.1446. 1. Draw a circle with a center at [0.1446, 0.1446] and a radius of 0.1446. Scale the 2D sketch with a factor of 0.2893, transform it into a 3D sketch, and extrude it with a depth of 0.2462 in the normal direction. There will be no extrusion in the opposite direction. The scaling factor for the sketch is 0.2893, and the operation is joining with the current solid body. **Intermediate CAD Part 2 Measurements** The length of the part is 0.2893 units.
