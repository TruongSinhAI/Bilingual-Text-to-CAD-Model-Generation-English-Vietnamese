However, for a simple rectangular sketch, sketch_scale is often 1.0 unless explicitly mentioned for a specific transformation.

The eighth and final line ends at (0.1108, 0.1326) and connects back to the starting point (0, 0.1223). Scale the sketch by 0.2695 and extrude it by 0.2344 units in the direction opposite to the normal.
