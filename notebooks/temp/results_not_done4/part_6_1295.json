    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Long Cylindrical Object with Tapered End and Parallel Ridges The final shape to be constructed is a long, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end, featuring a series of parallel ridges along its length. In order to create this shape, we need to follow a series of steps, which include creating a new coordinate system, a 2D sketch, transforming the sketch into a 3D sketch, and finally extruding the sketch to form the 3D model. The sketch consists of several faces, each face containing loops, and each loop being formed by curves. Here are the detailed instructions for constructing this part: Creating a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] Creating a 2D Sketch Now, create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the newly created coordinate system. Drawing Face 1 Draw the first face `face_1` according to the following curve scheme: * arc (1) with start point [0.0, 0.0], mid point [0.0106, 0.0044], and end point [0.015, 0.015] * line (1) with start point [0.015, 0.015] and end point [0.015, 0.0462] * arc (2) with start point [0.015, 0.0462], mid point [0.017, 0.054], and end point [0.0225, 0.06] * line (2) with start point [0.0225, 0.06] and end point [0.0225, 0.075] * arc (3) with start point [0.0225, 0.075], mid point [0.0278, 0.0772], and end point [0.03, 0.0825] * line (3) with start point [0.03, 0.0825] and end point [0.03, 0.0943] * arc (4) with start point [0.03, 0.0943], mid point [0.0318, 0.1019], and end point [0.0369, 0.1077] * arc (5) with start point [0.0369, 0.1077], mid point [0.0447, 0.1273], and end point [0.0302, 0.1425] * line (4) with start point [0.0302, 0.1425] and end point [0.0, 0.15] * line (5) with start point [0.0, 0.15] and end point [0.0, 0.0] The loop is always closed, contains multiple lines and/or arcs, and does not consist of a line and a circle, or an arc and a circle. Transforming the 2D Sketch into a 3D Sketch Following the 2D sketch creation, estimate the normals and transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector as specified in the coordinate system section. Extruding the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis to form the 3D model by specifying the following extrusion properties: * extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.75 * extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 * sketch_scale: 0.15 For this part, the scaling parameter (sketch_scale) is set to 0.15, which is the height of the part. Remember to join or add material when extruding the shape to maintain the correct orientation of the part in relation to the final shape's tapered end. The overall shape, dimensions, and scale of this individual part and its corresponding curves, loops, and faces align with those found in the given \"CAD Assembly JSON\" data. By following these instructions, the junior CAD designer can accurately replicate this intermediate part of the long, cylindrical object.</description>",
