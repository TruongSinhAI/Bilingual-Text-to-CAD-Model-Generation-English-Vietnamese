The euler angles for this system are -90.0, 0.0, and -90.0, and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and a loop (loop\\\\_1) on this face. The loop consists of the following curves: - Line 1: Starting at [0.0, 0.0] and ending at [0.6842, 0.0] - Line 2: Starting at [0.6842, 0.0] and ending at [0.6842, 0.1316] - Line 3: Starting at [0.6842, 0.1316] and ending at [0.1842, 0.1316] - Line 4: Starting at [0.1842, 0.1316] and ending at [0.0526, 0.75] - Line 5: Starting at [0.0526, 0.75] and ending at [0.0, 0.75] - Line 6: Starting at [0.0, 0.75] and ending at [0.0, 0.0] The loop is a closed loop, and no two adjacent segments can be lines and arcs. The outer loop must be the one described here. The sketch will now be scaled by a factor of 0.75. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.0197 units, and 0.0 units against the normal. The sketch scale used during extrusion is 0.75. The resulting part is a rectangular prism with a curved side, consistent with the description's shape. The length, width, and height of part 1 are 0.0197, 0.75, and 0.75 units, respectively. This description reflects the parameters from the JSON data provided for part 1. Since there's no existing CAD model, the boolean operation of this part will result in the creation of a new solid body.</description>",
