Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by a depth of 0.1042 units and along the opposite normal direction by 0 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.7497 before extrusion. The operation for this extrusion is to create a new solid body. This part has a length of approximately 0.75 units, a width of approximately 0.75 units, and a height of approximately 0.104 units.
