    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Rectangular Prism** The first part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.

Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector [0.5625, 0.3047, 0.0]. This will position the prism at the desired location and orientation. Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system.

Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector by 0.1523 units and along the opposite normal vector by 0.1523 units. This will create the 3D model for the first part. **Part 2: Larger Rectangular Prism** The second part is a larger rectangular prism that joins with the first part. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Next, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system.

Extrude the 2D sketch along the opposite normal vector by 0.6094 units. This will create the 3D model for the second part, joining with the first part to form the final shape. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The front face is angled, creating a sense of depth.
