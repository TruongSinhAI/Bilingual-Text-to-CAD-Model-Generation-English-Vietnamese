    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Construct a rectangular prism with a tapered front face and a circular hole in the center. Step 1: Create a new coordinate system Begin by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0385, 0.0]. Step 2: Draw a 2D sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Step 3: Draw the first face (face_1) Draw a circle with a center at [0.1923, 0.1923] and a radius of 0.1923. This will create a circular loop. Step 4: Draw the second face (face_2) 1. Draw a line from [0.2385, 0.0056] to [0.6915, 0.1176]. 2. Draw an arc from [0.6915, 0.1176] to [0.6915, 0.267] with the midpoint at [0.5962, 0.1923]. 3. Draw a line from [0.6915, 0.267] to [0.2385, 0.379]. 4. Draw an arc from [0.2385, 0.379] to [0.2385, 0.0056] with the midpoint at [0.3846, 0.1923]. This will create a loop with four curves. Step 5: Draw the third face (face_3) Draw a circle with a center at [0.6731, 0.1923] and a radius of 0.0769. Step 6: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. Step 7: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Use the specified euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. Step 8: Extrude the 3D model Extrude the 3D model along the positive Z-axis by a depth of 0.0385 units and along the negative Z-axis by a depth of 0.0. The final dimensions of the part are approximately 10 units in length, 5 units in width, and 3 units in height.

Step 5: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch Use the specified euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. Step 6: Extrude the 3D model Extrude the 3D model along the negative Z-axis by a depth of 0.3205 units and along the positive Z-axis by a depth of 0.0. The final dimensions of the part are approximately 0.0769 units in length, 0.3205 units in width, and 0.0769 units in height. Step 7: Cut the first part with the second part Cut the first part (rectangular prism with tapered front face and circular hole) with the second part (cylindrical object with tapered end) using the \"CutFeatureOperation\" boolean operation. The result is the intersecting volume between the two parts.</description>",
