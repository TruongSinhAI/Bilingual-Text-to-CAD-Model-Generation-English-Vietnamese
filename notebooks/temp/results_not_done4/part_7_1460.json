    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Cylindrical Object with a Central Hole and a Flat Top and Bottom Construct a cylindrical object with a central hole and a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0938. Sketch: Create a sketch on the XY plane (face_1) of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of two loops (loop_1 and loop_2). Loop_1: Loop_1 is a circle with a center point at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. Loop_2: Loop_2 is also a circle with a center point at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.0937. Extrusion: Extrude the sketch along its normal by 0.0469 units. Additionally, extrude the sketch by 0.0469 units along the opposite direction of the normal. Since the \"sketch\\_scale\" parameter is 0.75, apply this scaling factor to the sketch before extrusion. This operation creates a new body (NewBodyFeatureOperation). Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Tapered Center Design a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.2344, 0.2344, 0.0938. Sketch: Create a sketch on the XY plane (face_1) of the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single loop (loop_1). Loop_1: Loop_1 is a circle with a center point at (0.1406, 0.1406) and a radius of 0.1406. Extrusion: The sketch is extruded up to the opposite direction of the normal by 0.0938 units (cutting into the previous part at the same time, as instructed by CutFeatureOperation).
