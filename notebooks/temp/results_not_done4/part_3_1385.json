Creating the 2D sketch Create a new 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. Drawing the curves and creating the loops 1. Draw the first line from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.7436, 0.0). 2. Draw the second line from the point (0.7436, 0.0) to the point (0.7436, 0.2479). 3. Draw the third line from the point (0.7436, 0.2479) to the point (0.0, 0.2479). 4. Draw the fourth line from the point (0.0, 0.2479) to the point (0.0, 0.0). This results in a closed loop with 4 lines. Creating the faces Create a face using the loop.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>No</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description identifies \\\"Part 1\\\" and \\\"Part 2\\\", which will correspond to \\\"part_1\\\" and \\\"part_2\\\" in the JSON.\\n\\npart_1:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from \\\"Euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, -90.0\\\").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.4957, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"translation vector of 0.0, 0.4957, 0.0\\\").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1: (Derived from \\\"Creating the faces Create a face using the loop.\\\").\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.7436, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"Draw the first line from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.7436, 0.0)\\\").\\n----line_2: Start [0.7436, 0.0], End [0.7436, 0.6196] (Derived from \\\"Draw the second line from the point (0.7436, 0.0) to the point (0.7436, 0.6196)\\\").\\n----line_3: Start [0.7436, 0.6196], End [0.4957, 0.6196] (Derived from \\\"Draw the third line from the point (0.7436, 0.6196) to the point (0.4957, 0.6196)\\\").\\n----line_4: Start [0.4957, 0.6196], End [0.4957, 0.4957] (Derived from \\\"Draw the fourth line from the point (0.4957, 0.6196) to the point (0.4957, 0.4957)\\\").\\n----line_5: Start [0.4957, 0.4957], End [0.2479, 0.4957] (Derived from \\\"Draw the fifth line from the point (0.4957, 0.4957) to the point (0.2479, 0.4957)\\\").\\n----line_6: Start [0.2479, 0.4957], End [0.2479, 0.6196] (Derived from \\\"Draw the sixth line from the point (0.2479, 0.4957) to the point (0.2479, 0.6196)\\\").\\n----line_7: Start [0.2479, 0.6196], End [0.0, 0.6196] (Derived from \\\"Draw the seventh line from the point (0.2479, 0.6196) to the point (0.0, 0.6196)\\\").\\n----line_8: Start [0.0, 0.6196], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"Draw the eighth line from the point (0.0, 0.6196) to the point (0.0, 0.0)\\\").\\n-extrusion: No extrusion details are provided in the description for Part 1.\\n\\npart_2:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from \\\"Euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, -90.0\\\").\\n--Translation Vector: [0.0064, 0.4957, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"translation vector of 0.0064, 0.4957, 0.0\\\").\\n-sketch:\\n--face_1: (Derived from \\\"Creating the faces Create a face using the loop.\\\").\\n---loop_1:\\n----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.7436, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"Draw the first line from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.7436, 0.0)\\\").\\n----line_2: Start [0.7436, 0.0], End [0.7436, 0.2479] (Derived from \\\"Draw the second line from the point (0.7436, 0.0) to the point (0.7436, 0.2479)\\\").\\n----line_3: Start [0.7436, 0.2479], End [0.0, 0.2479] (Derived from \\\"Draw the third line from the point (0.7436, 0.2479) to the point (0.0, 0.2479)\\\").\\n----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.2479], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from \\\"Draw the fourth line from the point (0.0, 0.2479) to the point (0.0, 0.0)\\\").\\n-extrusion: No extrusion details are provided in the description for Part 2.\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check Part 1:\\n--Coordinate system: Euler Angles and Translation Vector match the JSON.\\n--Sketch: The start and end points of all 8 lines are precisely as specified in the description and match the JSON.
