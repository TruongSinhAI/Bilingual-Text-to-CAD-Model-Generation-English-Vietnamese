In typical CAD software, such exact duplication of sketch entities without distinct purpose (e.g., in different planes or for different features) is not standard and often indicates an error or redundancy.\\n  - Because the JSON includes these redundant `face_2` to `face_5` which duplicate the circular loops already defined within `face_1`, and the description, while ambiguous, contributes to this redundancy, there's a significant mismatch in the logical and efficient representation of the sketch geometry.\\n- Extrusion: The extrusion depths and sketch scale match the description.
