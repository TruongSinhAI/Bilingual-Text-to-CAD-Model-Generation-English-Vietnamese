However, the JSON shows only one face (`face_1`) which contains two loops (`loop_1` and `loop_2`). This is a fundamental structural mismatch.\\n\\n- Check Face 1, Loop 1 Geometry (comparing JSON with description's stated points for Face 1, Loop 1):\\n  - JSON `arc_1`: Start [0.0, 0.015], Mid [0.0044, 0.0044], End [0.015, 0.0] -> Matches description's Arc 1.\\n  - JSON `line_1`: Start [0.015, 0.0], End [0.075, 0.0] -> Matches description's Line 1.\\n  - JSON `arc_2`: Start [0.075, 0.0], Mid [0.0856, 0.0044], End [0.09, 0.015] -> Does NOT match description's Arc 2 (description: [0.075, 0.09] to [0.09, 0.075]).

The coordinates in JSON's `loop_2` (e.g., `arc_1` Start Point [0.0045, 0.015]) are significantly different from `loop_1`'s (Start Point [0.0, 0.015]), indicating it's not a simple rotation of the exact same geometry but a completely different, smaller loop. This is a major discrepancy.\\n\\n- Check Extrusion Parameters: `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.75), `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0), and `sketch_scale` (0.09) match the JSON. The operation is correctly inferred as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\".\\n\\n- Conclusion: The JSON does not accurately represent the described sketch geometry due to structural differences (number of faces vs. loops) and significant discrepancies in the coordinates and ordering of lines/arcs within the sketch.\\n</think>"
