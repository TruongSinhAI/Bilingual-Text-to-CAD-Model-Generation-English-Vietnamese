    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Pointed End** The first part of the CAD assembly is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a pointed end. This part is constructed by creating a new coordinate system and then performing the following steps: 1. **Create the 2D sketch**: Begin by creating a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Define the sketching plane using the `coordinate_system` property. 2. **Draw the rectangular face**: Draw a rectangle on the X-Y plane. The rectangle is defined by four lines. Start from the point (0, 0), draw a line to the point (0.75, 0), then draw another line to the point (0.75, 0.2679), then draw the third line to the point (0, 0.2679), and finally draw the last line back to the starting point (0, 0). These lines are defined in `\"face_1\"` under the `\"sketch\"` property with lines named `\"line_1\"` through `\"line_4\"`. The resulting face should be a rectangular shape, with a length of 0.75 units and a width of 0.2679 units. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch**: Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the `sketch_scale` parameter. This scaling ensures that the final extruded shape has the desired dimensions according to the `\"description\"` property in the JSON data. 4. **Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch**: Rotate the scaled 2D sketch by the euler angles provided in the `Euler_Angles` array (0, 0, 0 degrees in this case); transform it in the X-Y plane by the values specified in the `translation_vector` array (0, 0, 0); and create the 3D sketch. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch**: Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0161 units towards the normal and by 0 units in the opposite direction, according to the `extrusion` property in the JSON data. The result is the first part of the CAD assembly: a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a pointed end. Here are the final dimensions of the part: - Length: 0.5625 units (0.75 × 0.75, considering both the length and width of the rectangular face) - Width: 0.198 units (0.2679 × 0.75, considering both the length and width of the rectangular face) - Height: 0.0161 units (extrusion depth towards the normal)</description>",
