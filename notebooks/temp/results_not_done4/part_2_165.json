For the second 2D sketch, create a new face and add four lines to form a smaller rectangle with a size of 0.0554 x 0.0055, centered in the first rectangle. **Step 3: Extruding the 2D Sketches** Extrude the first 2D sketch along the normal by a distance of 0.0155 units. Extrude the second 2D sketch along the normal by a distance of 0.0155 units, and use a boolean operation to subtract it from the first extrusion. **Step 4: Finalizing the CAD Model** Combine the first and second parts using a boolean operation to join them, resulting in the final CAD model of a rectangular prism with a curved, pointed end. The prism has a flat base and a flat top, and the pointed end is slightly tapered. The model is symmetrical along the central axis.</description>",
