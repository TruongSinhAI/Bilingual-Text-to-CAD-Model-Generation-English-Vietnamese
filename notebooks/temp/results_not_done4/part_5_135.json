Extruding the smaller rectangle to generate the 3D model Now extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model for part 2. 1. **Extruding the rectangle**: Extrude the rectangle in the direction parallel to the z-axis by 0.25 units, creating a smaller rectangular prism. 2. **Join the existing body**: Join the smaller rectangular prism to the original rectangular prism to combine them. The result will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section, consisting of the base prism and the smaller prism. The entire structure is scaled down by half in both length and width compared to part 1. The height of the final shape is determined by the sum of all extrusion depths.</description>",
