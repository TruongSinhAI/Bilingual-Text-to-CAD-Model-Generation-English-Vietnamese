For the sketch, create a new face (face_1) and add two loops (loop_1 and loop_2). Loop_1 consists of a circle (circle_1) with a center at [0.1, 0.1] and a radius of 0.1. Loop_2 consists of another circle (circle_1) with the same center and a radius of 0.0375. This will create a ring shape in the sketch plane.
