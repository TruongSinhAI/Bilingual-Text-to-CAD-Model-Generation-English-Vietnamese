This makes the description inconsistent with the JSON for loop_2.-Correction: The description for loop_2 is incorrect. It should specify five lines as in the JSON to form the correct shape. The current description implies a diagonal for line_4 which is not present in the JSON, and it misses line_5.</think>"
