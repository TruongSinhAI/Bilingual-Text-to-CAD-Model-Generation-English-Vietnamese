Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch and set the euler angles to the new coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch by `extrude_depth_towards_normal` = 0.1875 and `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` = 0.1875 to generate the 3D prism. Wrap up this part of the CAD model with the `NewBodyFeatureOperation` operation to create a new solid body.</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description specifies a single part, \"\n      ,\"part_1\"\n      ,\".\\n\\npart_1: (Rectangular Prism with a Hole)\\n- coordinate_system:\\n  - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Explicitly stated)\\n  - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.375] (Explicitly stated)\\n- sketch:\\n  - face_1:\\n    - loop_1: (Outer rectangle)\\n      - line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.04, 0.0]\\n      - line_2: Start [0.04, 0.0], End [0.04, 0.04]\\n      - line_3: Start [0.04, 0.04], End [0.0, 0.04]\\n      - line_4: Start [0.0, 0.04], End [0.0, 0.0]\\n    - loop_2: (Inner rectangle for hole)\\n      - line_1: Start [0.0025, 0.0025], End [0.0375, 0.0025]\\n      - line_2: Start [0.0375, 0.0025], End [0.0375, 0.0375]\\n      - line_3: Start [0.0375, 0.0375], End [0.0025, 0.0375]\\n      - line_4: Start [0.0025, 0.0375], End [0.0025, 0.0025]\\n- extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1875 (Derived from \"\n      ,\"extrude_depth_towards_normal` = 0.1875\"\n      ,\")\\n  - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.1875 (Derived from \"\n      ,\"extrude_depth_opposite_normal` = 0.1875\"\n      ,\")\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.04 (Derived from \"\n      ,\"sketch_scale = 0.04\"\n      ,\")\\n  - operation: \"\n      ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n      ,\" (Explicitly stated)\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n- Check Coordinate System:\\n  - Euler Angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and Translation Vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.375] are directly from the description and match the JSON.\\n\\n- Check Sketch (loop_1 - outer rectangle):\\n  - All 4 lines connect sequentially to form a closed rectangle: (0.0,0.0) -> (0.04,0.0) -> (0.04,0.04) -> (0.0,0.04) -> (0.0,0.0). All coordinates match the JSON.\\n\\n- Check Sketch (loop_2 - inner rectangle for hole):\\n  - All 4 lines connect sequentially to form a closed rectangle: (0.0025,0.0025) -> (0.0375,0.0025) -> (0.0375,0.0375) -> (0.0025,0.0375) -> (0.0025,0.0025). All coordinates match the JSON. The inner rectangle is correctly defined within the outer one, which is consistent with creating a prism with a hole.\\n\\n- Check Extrusion:\\n  - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1875 and extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.1875 are explicitly stated and match the JSON. This results in a total extrusion depth of 0.375.\\n  - sketch_scale: 0.04 is explicitly stated and matches the JSON.\\n  - operation: \"\n      ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n      ,\" is explicitly stated and matches the JSON.\\n\\n- Overall Consistency:\\n  - All numerical values and geometric definitions precisely match those in the JSON.\\n  - The combination of an outer and inner loop, extruded symmetrically, correctly creates a rectangular prism with a rectangular hole through its center.\\n\\n- Correction: No corrections are necessary. The inferred details are accurate and complete.\\n</think>"
