The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 3 units in length, 2 units in width, and 1 unit in height. **Step 1: Draw the 2D Sketch** For the first part, we will create a new coordinate system. With this new coordinate system, we will start by drawing a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane (since the Euler angles are set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]). Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane, and then construct the rectangular prism's shape using lines. 1. Line 1: Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.0). 2. Line 2: Draw a line from point (0.75, 0.0) to point (0.75, 0.4687). 3. Line 3: Draw a line from point (0.75, 0.4687) to point (0.0, 0.4687). 4. Line 4: Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.4687) to point (0.0, 0.0). **Step 2: Apply the Scaling Parameter** We have the sketch scale set to 0.75. Apply the scaling to the sketch created in the previous step. **Step 3: Transform the scalable 2D Sketch into 3D** With the scaled 2D sketch completed, set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using these euler angles and translation vector values. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D Sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis with an extrusion depth of 0.375 toward the normal and 0.0 in the opposite direction. This will create the desired rectangular prism with its dimensions. Based on the coordinate system, sketch, and extrusion properties, the height of the first part (the rectangular prism) is 0.375 units, and the length and width are both 0.75 units based on the sketch and scaling parameter used. Next, proceed with the instructions for the next parts, following this pattern of producing clear and concise instructions that describe the sequence of sketches, loops, faces, and shapes.
