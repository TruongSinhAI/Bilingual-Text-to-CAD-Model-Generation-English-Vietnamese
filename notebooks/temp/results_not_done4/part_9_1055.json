Apply a boolean operation to the original prism with this new solid to create the cylindrical hole. (Note: The final shape is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The hole is cylindrical with a diameter of 1/3 of the prism's width. The prism is positioned at a 45 degree angle.) The provided instructions should be enough to construct an accurate CAD model of the given final shape. Remember to follow the instructions precisely, particularly when creating and positioning the coordinate systems, and when creating sketches, scaling them, and extruding to generate 3D models.</description>",
