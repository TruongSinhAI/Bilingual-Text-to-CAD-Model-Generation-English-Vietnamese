However, the JSON for face_3.loop_1 contains 4 lines ([0.0277, 0.0] to [0.0872, 0.0], [0.0872, 0.0] to [0.0872, 0.2121], [0.0872, 0.2121] to [0.0277, 0.2121], [0.0277, 0.2121] to [0.0277, 0.0]).

It should describe a \"\n  ,\n    \"four-line loop\"\n  ,\n    \" instead of a \"\n  ,\n    \"three-line loop\"\n  ,\n    \" to match the provided JSON data for line count and shape.\\n</think>"
