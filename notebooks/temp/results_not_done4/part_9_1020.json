Step 3: Draw the first loop 1. Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0]. 2. Draw a line from point [0.75, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.48]. 3. Draw a line from point [0.75, 0.48] to point [0.0, 0.48]. 4. Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.48] to point [0.0, 0.0]. This loop creates the outer boundary of the rectangular prism. Step 4: Draw the second loop 1. Draw a line from point [0.055, 0.055] to point [0.695, 0.055]. 2. Draw a line from point [0.695, 0.055] to point [0.695, 0.425]. 3. Draw a line from point [0.695, 0.425] to point [0.055, 0.425]. 4. Draw a line from point [0.055, 0.425] to point [0.055, 0.055]. This loop creates the inner boundary of the prism, forming the triangular cutout. Step 5: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch with a scaling factor of 0.75. Step 6: Transform the 2D sketch to 3D Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Step 7: Extrude the 2D sketch to 3D model Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis (normal direction) by 0.0075 units. This will create the final 3D model for the rectangular prism with a triangular cutout. The dimensions of the object are: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.0075 units Step 8: Determine the boolean operation (omitted) Since we started with an empty coordinate system, use a \"JoinFeatureOperation\" to combine the newly extruded form with the base coordinate system. Step 9: Save and name the coordinate system Save and name the coordinate system as \"Part 1 - Rectangular Prism with Triangular Cutout.\" That concludes the process of creating Part 1 of the CAD assembly. Note: Please repeat this process for each subsequent part as per the provided JSON instructions, ensuring to maintain clear headings, section breaks, and descriptive texts. Additionally, update the \"previous part\" information when instructing the junior designer regarding the boolean operation of the current body, as required.</description>",
