No corrections needed.\\n\\n- Sketch (face_1):\\n  - Loop 1: The Start and End points for all six lines (Line 1 to Line 6) precisely match the JSON. Let's verify connectivity:\\n    - Line 1 (End Point [0.3242, 0.0]) connects to Line 2 (Start Point [0.3242, 0.0]).\\n    - Line 2 (End Point [0.6495, 0.1866]) connects to Line 3 (Start Point [0.6495, 0.1866]).\\n    - Line 3 (End Point [0.6506, 0.5616]) connects to Line 4 (Start Point [0.6506, 0.5616]).\\n    - Line 4 (End Point [0.3263, 0.75]) connects to Line 5 (Start Point [0.3263, 0.75]).\\n    - Line 5 (End Point [0.0011, 0.5634]) connects to Line 6 (Start Point [0.0011, 0.5634]).\\n    - Line 6 (End Point [0.0, 0.1884]) connects back to Line 1 (Start Point [0.0, 0.1884]), ensuring a closed loop. No corrections needed.\\n  - Loop 2: The Center (0.3253, 0.375) and Radius (0.1999) for Circle 1 match the JSON exactly. No corrections needed.\\n\\n- Extrusion: The extrude_depth_towards_normal (0.3248), extrude_depth_opposite_normal (0.0), and sketch_scale (0.75) values match the JSON. The operation \"        ,\"new body feature operation\"        ,\" correctly corresponds to \"        ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"        ,\" in the JSON.
