    "prompt": "<description>**CAD Model Generation Instructions** **Part 1** Construct a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. It has a hollow center and is slightly curved along its length. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0, 0.75, 0) with euler angles (0, 0, -90) degrees. Create a sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch consists of two loops on a single face (face\\\\_1). The first loop (loop\\\\_1) is a circle with center at (0.1875, 0.1875) and radius of 0.1875. The second loop (loop\\\\_2) is also a circle with the same center but a smaller radius of 0.1406. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.75 units and scale it by 0.375. Set the extrusion operation to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\". **Part 1 Details:** Shape: Cylindrical object Length: 0.375 Width: 0.75 Height: 0.375 **Part 2** Create a curved, metallic object with a smooth surface, resembling a pipe or tube, with a slightly tapered shape. Start by creating a new coordinate system at (0.375, 0.1317, 0.1875) with no rotation (euler angles = [0, 0, 0]) and a translation vector of [0.375, 0.1317, 0.1875]. Sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch comprises a single face (face\\\\_1) with one loop (loop\\\\_1). The loop contains four curves: two lines and two arcs. The first line (line\\\\_1) starts at (0, 0) and ends at (0, 0.0533). The first arc (arc\\\\_1) starts at the endpoint of the first line, has a midpoint at (0.158, 0.3007), and ends at (0, 0.5482). The second line (line\\\\_2) starts at the endpoint of the first arc and ends at (0, 0.5945). The second arc (arc\\\\_2) starts at the endpoint of the second line, has a midpoint at (0.209, 0.2972), and ends at the start point of the first line. Extrude the sketch along both the normal and opposite normal directions by 0.0094 units. Scale the sketch by 0.5945 and set the extrusion operation to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\". **Part 2 Details:** Shape: Curved, metallic object Length: 0.5945 Width: 0.5945 Height: 0.0187 **Part 3** Create a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom and a slightly tapered middle section. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at (0, 0.75, 0) with euler angles (0, 0, -90) degrees. Create a sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch has a single loop (loop\\\\_1) on a single face (face\\\\_1). The loop consists of a circle with center at (0.1875, 0.1875) and radius of 0.1875. Extrude the sketch along the normal direction by 0.0375 units and set the extrusion operation to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\". **Part 3 Details:** Shape: Cylindrical object with flat top and bottom Length: 0.375 Width: 0.0375 Height: 0.375 Following the instructions above should result in the desired final shape: A cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom. It has a smooth surface and appears to be a solid, three-dimensional shape. The object is symmetrical along its central axis.</description>",
