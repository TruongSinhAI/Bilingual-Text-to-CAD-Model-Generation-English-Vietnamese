    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism The first part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The length of the sides is twice the height of the prism. The height of the prism is one-third of the length of the sides. The prism is centered on the white background. First, create a new coordinate system with the following parameters: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0382, 0.0] Next, create the 2D sketch for this part. The sketch is composed of two faces, face\\\\_1 and face\\\\_2, which are identical. Each face contains one loop, loop\\\\_1, which is a rectangle. For each loop: - loop\\\\_1 contains 4 lines Face 1: - line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.1188, 0.0] - line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.1188, 0.0], End Point [0.1188, 0.6174] - line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.1188, 0.6174], End Point [0.0, 0.6174] - line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.6174], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Face 2: - loop\\\\_1 contains the same set of lines as Face 1 After creating the sketch, scale it using the sketch\\\\_scale parameter with a value of 0.6174. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the sketch to generate the 3D model. Configure the extrusion as follows: - extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal: 0.0382 - extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal: 0.0 - sketch\\\\_scale: 0.6174 - Set the boolean operation to 'NewBodyFeatureOperation'. For additional information, the dimensions and shape of each intermediate CAD part, as well as the final shape, are as follows: - length: 0.6174 - width: 0.0382 - height: 0.6174</description>",

Sketch scale (if used): value (mention value) Ensure any necessary boolean operations have been applied for the overall design. Throughout the instructions, you should detail the shapes, curves, arcs, lines, loops, and faces as required without referring to specific boolean operation terms. Instead, describe Boolean operations like join, cut, or intersect using natural language in the context of the overall final shape or intermediate parts.
