Create loop_1 and circle_1 in the sketch with center at [0.3543, 0.3543] and radius 0.3543. 4. Create loop_2 and circle_1 in the sketch with center at [0.3543, 0.3543] and radius 0.2082. 5. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.7087. 6. Extrude the sketch by 0 towards the normal and 0.0709 towards the opposite direction of the normal. **Construct the third part: A cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section.** 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles [90, 0, -90] and translation vector [0, 0.7293, 0.0207]. 2. Begin by creating the sketch on face_1 of the coordinate system. 3.

To achieve a \"\n    ,\"Yes\"\n    ,\" validation, the description should specify the boolean operation for each part (e.g., \"\n    ,\"The operation is a new body feature operation\"\n    ,\" or \"\n    ,\"The operation is a cut feature operation\"\n    ,\").</think>"
