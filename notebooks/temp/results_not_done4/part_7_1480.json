    "prompt": "<description>**CAD Modeling Instructions** **Part 1: Straight-Sided Rectangular Prism** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. The euler angles for this coordinate system are 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 degrees and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0197, 0.0]. For the sketch of part 1, create a new face and then a loop on that face. Within this loop, create 4 lines as follows: - Line 1: Start point [0.0, 0.0], end point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start point [0.75, 0.0], end point [0.75, 0.3289] - Line 3: Start point [0.75, 0.3289], end point [0.0, 0.3289] - Line 4: Start point [0.0, 0.3289], end point [0.0, 0.0] After creating the 2D sketch, use a scaling factor of 0.75 to scale it. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.0066 towards the normal and 0.0 opposite the normal to create part 1. This results in a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. **Part 2: Cylindrical Object** Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 2. The euler angles for this coordinate system are 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 degrees and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0132, 0.0]. For the sketch of part 2, create a new face and then a loop on that face. Within this loop, create 4 lines as follows: - Line 1: Start point [0.0, 0.0], end point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start point [0.75, 0.0], end point [0.75, 0.0132] - Line 3: Start point [0.75, 0.0132], end point [0.0, 0.0132] - Line 4: Start point [0.0, 0.0132], end point [0.0, 0.0] After creating the 2D sketch, use a scaling factor of 0.75 to scale it. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.0132 towards the normal to create part 2. This results in a simple, cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, connected by a straight, vertical line. **Part 3: Curved Surface** (Note: TheJSON does not provide sufficient information to construct Part 3. Please use the following instructions to construct a curved surface that connects Parts 1 and 2.) Begin by creating a new coordinate system for Part 3. Use the same euler angles and translation vector as Part 2. For the sketch, create a new face and then a loop on that face. Within this loop, create a series of connected arcs that follow the contour of the desired curved surface, starting at the top-right corner of Part 1 and ending at the top-right corner of Part 2. The number of arcs will depend on the desired level of detail for the curved surface. For example, if the curved surface should have a gradual curve, use more arcs with smaller radii; if the curved surface should have a sharper curve, use fewer arcs with larger radii. After creating the 2D sketch, scale it using a scaling factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch by a depth of 0.0166 towards the normal, which is the difference in height between Parts 1 and 2, to create Part 3. This results in a curved surface that connects Parts 1 and 2.</description>",
