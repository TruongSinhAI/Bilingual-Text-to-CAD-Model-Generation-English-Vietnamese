Step 2: Draw the 2D sketch Next, create a new sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. In this sketch, draw a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. Step 3: Face 1, Loop 1 * Line 1: Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.0]. * Line 2: Draw a line from point [0.75, 0.0] to point [0.75, 0.6638]. * Line 3: Draw a line from point [0.75, 0.6638] to point [0.5625, 0.6638]. * Line 4: Draw a line from point [0.5625, 0.6638] to point [0.5625, 0.4569]. * Line 5: Draw a line from point [0.5625, 0.4569] to point [0.1875, 0.4569]. * Line 6: Draw a line from point [0.1875, 0.4569] to point [0.1875, 0.681]. * Line 7: Draw a line from point [0.1875, 0.681] to point [0.0, 0.681]. * Line 8: Draw a line from point [0.0, 0.681] to point [0.0, 0.0]. Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Step 5: Transform the 2D sketch into 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrude depth towards the normal is 0.75 and the extrude depth opposite the normal is 0.0. This will result in the creation of a new solid body with a flat top and bottom and a cylindrical hole in the center. The length, width, and height of the final shape are 0.75, 0.75, and 0.75 respectively. The prism is slightly tilted to the right. Note: The final CAD model is a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The prism has a flat top and bottom and is slightly tilted to the right. The cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism.</description>",
