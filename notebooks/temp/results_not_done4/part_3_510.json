In this coordinate system, create a sketch on face 1 and construct two loops. Loop 1: 1. Create a circle with a center at [0.1771, 0.1771] and a radius of 0.1771. Loop 2: 1. Create a circle with a center at [0.1771, 0.1771] and a radius of 0.1521. After you have created the loops, scale the sketch by a factor of 0.3542. Lastly, extrude the scaled sketch along the normal vector by 0.25 units. This will create a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. The height of the cylinder is approximately three times its diameter. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. The length and width are both 0.3542 units and the height is 0.25 units. **Part 2 - Construct a cylindrical object with a concave top and bottom** In a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], create a sketch on face 1. In this coordinate system, create a sketch on face 1 and construct two loops. Loop 1: 1. Create a circle with a center at [0.375, 0.375] and a radius of 0.375. Loop 2: 1. Create a circle with a center at [0.375, 0.375] and a radius of 0.1771. After you have created the loops, scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Lastly, extrude the scaled sketch along the normal vector by 0.025 units. This will create a cylindrical object with a concave top and bottom. The cylinder is slightly tilted to the right. The length and width are both 0.75 units and the height is 0.025 units. With these instructions, you will create a cylindrical object with a central hole, resembling a washer or a ring. Part 1 and Part 2 are joined along the common faces to create the final shape. The length, width and height of the final shape are 0.75 units, 0.75 units and 0.025 units respectively.</description>",
