Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by a distance of 0.1087 units. Use the extrusion parameters as follows: - extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1087 - extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 - sketch_scale: 0.75 The resulting part will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a height of twice the width. The length of the prism will be three times the width. **Part 2: Construct the first tapered section of the prism** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: - Euler Angles: [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.75, 0.0054, 0.0054] Next, draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the new coordinate system.
