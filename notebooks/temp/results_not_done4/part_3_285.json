    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional, Rectangular Prism with a Triangular Cutout Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1. Set the Euler angles to (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) degrees and the translation vector to (0.0, 0.0262, 0.0). This will position and orient the part appropriately in the assembly. Sketch (Face 1) Next, create a 2D sketch on a plane aligned with the coordinate system. In the sketch, create face 1 with the following loops and curves: 1. Loop 1 * Line 1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0) * Line 2: (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.5046) * Line 3: (0.75, 0.5046) to (0.6188, 0.5046) * Line 4: (0.6188, 0.5046) to (0.1312, 0.0656) * Line 5: (0.1312, 0.0656) to (0.0, 0.0656) * Line 6: (0.0, 0.0656) to (0.0, 0.0) This loop forms the perimeter of face 1. Note that each line connects the end point of the previous line to create a closed sequence. Extrusion After completing the sketch, select the sketch for extrusion. Set the extrusion depth toward the normal at 0.0262 and the depth opposite the normal at 0.0. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. This will convert the 2D sketch into a 3D solid. The `NewBodyFeatureOperation` operation indicates that this will be a new solid independent from any preceding parts. Final Shape The final shape of this part is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one side. The prism has a flat base and a flat top, and is centered on the white background. The top and bottom faces of the prism are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the base. The height of the prism is approximately twice the width of the base. The edges of the prism are straight and the corners are sharp. The prism is symmetrical along its length.
