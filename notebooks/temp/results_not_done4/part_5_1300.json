Draw a circle centered at (0.2392, 0.2392) with a radius of 0.2392. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.4783. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the following euler angles and translation vector: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0.0 towards the normal and 0.1875 opposite the normal. This will create the second part of the CAD model. It is a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The object has a smooth surface and appears to be solid. The final CAD model consists of the above two parts. The height, width and length of each of the intermediate parts and the final shape are as provided in the JSON. The instructions provided are sufficient to generate an accurate CAD model, without making any additional assumptions.</description>",
