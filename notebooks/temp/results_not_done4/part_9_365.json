    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. For this part, the Euler Angles should be set to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the Translation Vector should be set to [0.0, 0.0038, 0.0]. Next, create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Within this sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1). On face\\\\_1, create a loop (loop\\\\_1) consisting of four lines (line\\\\_1, line\\\\_2, line\\\\_3, line\\\\_4) as follows: * line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] * line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.5625] * line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.75, 0.5625], End Point [0.0, 0.5625] * line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.5625], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Each loop must be closed, as demonstrated above. This particular loop consists of 4 lines. Now, scale the 2D sketch in all directions by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by using the rotation information from the coordinate system and the translation vector. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate a 3D model. For the extrusion, use an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.0038 units and an extrusion depth opposite normal of 0 units. The sketch scale should be set to 0.75. The operation for this part is a \"New Body Feature Operation.\" The final dimensions of this part are as follows: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.0037 units * Height: 0.75 units The next part will be created based on this part, using the defined operation (New Body Feature Operation).</description>",

There is only one face and one loop for this sketch. The loop is defined by the four lines mentioned above. The sketch is complete at this stage. Next, manually set the scale for the sketch considering the `sketch_scale` provided: 0.75.
