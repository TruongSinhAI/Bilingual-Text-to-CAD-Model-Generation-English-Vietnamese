    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Cylindrical Object with Central Hole** The object you will be creating is a cylindrical object with a central hole. This object has a smooth surface and is symmetrical along its central axis. The hole is also cylindrical and is located in the center of the object. The object is solid and has a uniform thickness throughout. The object is not connected, attached, or in contact with any other object, and it is stationary with no movement. **1.1 Create the coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system in the origin, with zero rotation angles and zero translation vector. This will serve as the base for our sketch and the object. **1.2 Create the sketch** Start a new sketch on the XY plane of the created coordinate system. The sketch will consist of the following: - Face 1: - Loop 1: Draw a circle with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. This will be the outer radius of the cylindrical object. - Loop 2: Draw another circle with the same center but a radius of 0.1875. This will be the inner radius, or the central hole. Since every loop is closed by definition, there's no need to specify additional closing or tangency constraints. **1.3 Transform the 2D sketch to 3D Sketch** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying Euler angles and the translation vector from the coordinate_system object. In this case, there's no need to modify the sketch's position as the coordinate system is at the origin with zero rotation and translation. **1.4 Extrude the 3D model** Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.375, and the depth opposite the normal to 0.0. The sketch_scale parameter is 0.75. The operation is a 'New Body Feature Operation', which essentially results in the creation of a solid, standalone body. Once completed, you should have a 3D parametric model of the desired cylindrical object with a central hole. **Dimensions:** Referring to the provided JSON and from the description, here are the dimensions for the final shape and the intermediate part: - Final shape: - Height: 0.375 - Width: 0.75 - Length: 0.75 - Intermediate part (Part 1): - Height: 0.375 - Width: 0.75 - Length: 0.75</description>",
