    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Long, Thin, Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom Construct a long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. This part will be created in four steps: defining the coordinate system, creating a 2D sketch, scaling the sketch, and extruding the sketch to create the 3D model. I. Define the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (rotate around Z-axis by 90 degrees, X-axis and Y-axis should remain unchanged) * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] (move the origin along the positive Y-axis by 0.75 units) II. Create the 2D Sketch Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the defined coordinate system. Draw a rectangle as follows: 1. Draw the first line from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.0031, 0.0). 2. Draw the second line from point (0.0031, 0.0) to point (0.0031, 0.0306). 3. Draw the third line from point (0.0031, 0.0306) to point (0.0, 0.0306). 4. Draw the fourth line from point (0.0, 0.0306) to point (0.0, 0.0). III. Scale the Sketch Apply a uniform scale transformation to the sketch using a scaling factor of 0.0306 to change the dimensions of the rectangle to the desired size. IV. Extrude the Sketch Extrude the scaled 2D sketch along the Z-axis to generate the 3D model. Use the following properties: 1. Extrude Depth Towards Normal (Z-axis): 0.75 2. Extrude Depth Opposite Normal (Z-axis): 0.0 This will create the desired long, thin, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, with the following dimensions: * Length: 0.0306 * Width: 0.75 * Height: 0.0306</description>",
