Begin by creating a new coordinate system for part 1 at the following location: (0.0161, 0.75, 0.0) with euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0). Create the first face of the sketch using a rectangle with corners at (0.0, 0.0) and (0.1742, 0.1742). The sketch should look like this: 1st Sketch * Line 1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.1742, 0.0) * Line 2: (0.1742, 0.0) to (0.1742, 0.1742) * Line 3: (0.1742, 0.1742) to (0.0, 0.1742) * Line 4: (0.0, 0.1742) to (0.0, 0.0) Close the loop and complete the sketch. Now, scale the sketch by a factor of 0.1742. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by rotating it -90.0 degrees around the z-axis using the euler angles provided earlier and then translating it by the translation vector. Next, extrude the sketch by 0.1742 units along the normal direction. This results in a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Part 2: Construct a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. Create a new coordinate system for part 2 at the following location: (0.0553, 0.615, 0.1742) with euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Create the first face of the sketch using a rectangle with corners at (0.0, 0.0) and (0.0958, 0.0958). The sketch should look like this: 2nd Sketch * Line 1: (0.0, 0.0) to (0.0958, 0.0) * Line 2: (0.0958, 0.0) to (0.0958, 0.0958) * Line 3: (0.0958, 0.0958) to (0.0, 0.0958) * Line 4: (0.0, 0.0958) to (0.0, 0.0) Close the loop and complete the sketch. Now, extrude the sketch in the opposite direction of the normal by 0.2178 units. This adds a slightly tapered top to part 1. Part 3: Construct a rectangular prism with a sloped side. Create a new coordinate system for part 3 at the following location: (0.0771, 0.5758, 0.061) with euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0). Create the first face of the sketch using a rectangle with corners at (0.0, 0.0) and (0.0523, 0.0523).
