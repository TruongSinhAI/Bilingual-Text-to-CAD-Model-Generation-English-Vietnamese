Here are the details for each line in loop\\\\_1: * line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.6881, 0.0] * line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.6881, 0.0], End Point [0.6881, 0.7038] * line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.6881, 0.7038], End Point [0.0, 0.7038] * line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.7038], End Point [0.0, 0.0] The second loop on face\\\\_1, loop\\\\_2, consists of 4 lines as well. Here are the details for each line in loop\\\\_2: * line\\\\_1: Start Point [0.0405, 0.0405], End Point [0.6477, 0.0405] * line\\\\_2: Start Point [0.6477, 0.0405], End Point [0.6477, 0.6633] * line\\\\_3: Start Point [0.6477, 0.6633], End Point [0.0405, 0.6633] * line\\\\_4: Start Point [0.0405, 0.6633], End Point [0.0405, 0.0405] Apply the scaling parameter, sketch\\\\_scale, to the 2D sketch. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system.
