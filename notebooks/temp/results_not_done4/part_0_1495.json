The prism has a flat top and bottom. - Create a new coordinate system at (0.2028, 0, 0.022) with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). - Begin by creating a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. - Draw a rectangle with the following dimensions: + Start point: (0, 0) + End point: (0.5472, 0.2736) - Draw a circle in the center of the rectangle, centered at (0.3591, 0.1368) with a radius of 0.077. - Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.5472. - Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. - Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth of 0.0137 towards the normal and no extrusion in the opposite direction of the normal. 2. **Part 2: Three-Dimensional, Rectangular Prism with Tapered Top and Bottom** - Construct a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a tapered top and bottom. - Create a new coordinate system at (0, 0.3118, 0) with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, -90.0). - Begin by creating a 2D sketch on the X-Z plane. - Draw three rectangles: + Rectangle 1: Start point (0, 0), End point (0.0171, 0.1197) + Rectangle 2: Start point (0.0171, 0.1197), End point (0, 0.1368) + Rectangle 3: Start point (0.0171, 0.1197), End point (0.1368, 0.1197) - Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.1368. - Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. - Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth of 0.3078 towards the normal and no extrusion in the opposite direction of the normal. 3. **Part 3: Cutout Cylinders** - Cut out two cylindrical shapes from the model. - Create a new coordinate system at (0.0577, 0.0874, 0.1368) with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). - Begin by creating a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane. - Draw two circles: + Circle 1: Center (0.0192, 0.0192), Radius 0.0192 + Circle 2: Center (0.0192, 0.156), Radius 0.0192 - Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.1753. - Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. - Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with 0 extrusion towards the normal and an extrusion depth of 0.1368 in the opposite direction of the normal. 4. **Part 4: Repeat Cutout Cylinders** - Repeat the same cutout cylinders from Part 3 at a different location. - Create a new coordinate system at (0.2605, 0.0492, 0.0357) with Euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). - Follow the same steps as Part 3. 5. **Part 5: Cylindrical Object with Two Central Hole** - Create a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom,</description>",
