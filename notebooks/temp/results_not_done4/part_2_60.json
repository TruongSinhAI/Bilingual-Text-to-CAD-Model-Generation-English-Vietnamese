This matches the JSON.\\n\\n-Check Sketch (face_1, loop_2): The start and end points for all four lines of the inner loop (loop_2) are precisely as described. They also form a closed rectangular loop. The inner loop's dimensions are (0.0547-0.0078) = 0.0469 units by (0.1172-0.0078) = 0.1094 units. This matches the JSON.\\n\\n-Check Extrusion Parameters: The `extrude_depth_towards_normal` (0.75), `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` (0.0 - inferred as positive direction only), and `sketch_scale` (0.125) all match the JSON. The `operation` \"  ,  \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"  ,  \" is explicitly stated and matches the JSON. This is correct.\\n\\n-Correction: The inferred data is consistent and accurate with the provided JSON. No corrections are necessary.\\n</think>"
