Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0.0227 in the positive Z direction. **Cylindrical Hole** To create the cylindrical hole, keep the existing 3D sketch active and follow these steps: 1. Create a new 2D sketch on a plane perpendicular to the Z axis and passing through the point [0.0303, 0.375, 0.0]. 2. Draw a circle with the following center and radius: * Center Point: [0.0303, 0.375, 0.0] * Radius: 0.05 3. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 4.
