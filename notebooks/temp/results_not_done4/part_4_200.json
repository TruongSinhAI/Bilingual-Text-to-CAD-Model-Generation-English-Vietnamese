In JSON, `face_3` `loop_2` (second loop of third face) is a circle at Center `[0.0673, 0.6161]`. `face_4` `loop_2` (second loop of fourth face) is a circle at Center `[0.0893, 0.6964]`. The centers are different, so these are NOT the \"\n            , \"same circle\"\n            , \".

In JSON, `face_7` `loop_2` (second loop of seventh face) is a circle at Center `[0.3393, 0.0536]`. Again, `face_3` `loop_2` is at `[0.0673, 0.6161]`.
