Begin by creating a new coordinate system with no rotation or translation. **Step 1: Draw a 2D sketch** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. Draw a rectangle using the \"line\\\\_1\", \"line\\\\_2\", \"line\\\\_3\", and \"line\\\\_4\" in the sketch definition. This rectangle has a length of 0.3553 units and a width of 0.3553 units.

This scaling operation does not change the shape of the rectangle but reduces its size. **Step 3: Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system definition. However, since the euler angles are (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and the translation vector is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), no transformation is needed in this case. **Step 4: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by a depth of 0.75 units to create the 3D model. The resulting part is a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The height of the prism is 0.75 units. This part is the base part for the final assembly.</description>",
