Part 1 Summary You have constructed a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the sides are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The length of the top face is approximately twice the length of the bottom face. The height of the prism is slightly more than the width of the top face. The prism is centered in the image.
