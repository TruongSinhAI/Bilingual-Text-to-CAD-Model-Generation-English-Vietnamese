    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: 3D Model of a Rectangular Prism with a Curved Top Edge** The first part is a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top edge. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.125, 0.0]. Now, create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system. The sketch consists of a series of lines and an arc. - Line 1: Start at [0.0, 0.0], End at [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start at [0.75, 0.0], End at [0.75, 0.125] - Line 3: Start at [0.75, 0.125], End at [0.6296, 0.25] - Arc 1: Start at [0.6296, 0.25], Mid at [0.375, 0.125], End at [0.1204, 0.25] - Line 4: Start at [0.1204, 0.25], End at [0.0, 0.125] - Line 5: Start at [0.0, 0.125], End at [0.0, 0.0] The loop is closed, consisting of 5 curves (4 lines and 1 arc). The sketch is then scaled by a factor of 0.75. The scaled 2D sketch is then transformed into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.125 units to create the 3D model. The operation is a \"New Body Feature Operation\". The final dimensions of the part are: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.125 units - Height: 0.25 units (from the base) + 0.125 units (from the extrusion) = 0.375 units.</description>",
