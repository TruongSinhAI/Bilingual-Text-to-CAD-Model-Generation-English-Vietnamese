However, the JSON structure shows face_1 and face_2 as part of the same sketch object, which typically implies they lie on the same 2D plane as established by the overall coordinate_system (which defines the XY plane for 2D sketches unless explicitly overridden per sketch or face in a different schema). The provided 2D coordinates [x,y] or [x,z] cannot be unambiguously interpreted as lying on a different plane without further JSON fields specifying the plane for face_2. If face_1 is on the XY plane using (X,Y) coordinates, then face_2 (with its 2D coordinates) would also be on the XY plane. This is a significant discrepancy.\\n-Check extrusion: The extrusion parameters (depths, scale, operation) directly match the description.\\n\\n-Correction: The description states \\\"Curved Side\\\" in the title, but the sketch only contains straight lines. More importantly, the description specifies \\\"Sketch on Face 2\\\" on the \\\"X-Z plane\\\" while the JSON structure for sketch object implies face_1 and face_2 are on the same plane defined by the part's coordinate system (which typically maps 2D sketch points to XY). This inconsistency in the sketch plane definition for face_2 makes the JSON inconsistent with the description for this aspect.\\n</think>"
