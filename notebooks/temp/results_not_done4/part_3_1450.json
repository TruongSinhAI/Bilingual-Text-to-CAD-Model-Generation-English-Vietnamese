The extrude depth towards the normal is 0.2344 and the sketch scale factor is 0.75. This completes the construction of the first part, which has the shape of a rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom.

The description's count of \"  \n                 ,  \"9 curves\"  ,  \"  and the explicit listing of curves (lines and one arc) do not match the total number of entities (11) and the presence of `arc_2` in the JSON.
