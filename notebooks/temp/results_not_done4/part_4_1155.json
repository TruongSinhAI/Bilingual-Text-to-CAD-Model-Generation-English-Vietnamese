Proceed with the instructions for the next intermediate CAD part or the final CAD model, keeping in mind the natural language descriptions for boolean operations. Remember to organize your instructions with clear headings, section breaks, and `<part_num>` tags to distinguish between parts.

The JSON needs to be corrected for Part 2 to include an arc or the description for Part 1 to correctly state opposite normal extrusion, and the description for Part 2 to remove the arc. As per instructions, no JSON correction is needed, only comparison.\\\\n</think>"
