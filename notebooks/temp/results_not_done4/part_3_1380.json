    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation. 1. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Create a rectangle by drawing four lines: - Line 1: Begin at (0.0, 0.0) and end at (0.75, 0.0). - Line 2: Begin at (0.75, 0.0) and end at (0.75, 0.75). - Line 3: Begin at (0.75, 0.75) and end at (0.0, 0.75). - Line 4: Begin at (0.0, 0.75) and end at (0.0, 0.0). 3. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 4. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following parameters: - Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) - Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) 5. Extrude the 2D sketch along the Z-axis with a depth of 0.5906 units. Part 2: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism (Cut) Create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom where the front and back faces are parallel to each other and the side faces are perpendicular. The object is centered in the image. This part will be integrated into the assembly by cutting a portion from Part 1, specifically a smaller rectangular prism with dimensions 0.375 x 0.375 x 0.2953 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin with no rotation, translated along the Z-axis by 0.5906 units (the height of Part 1). 1. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 2. Create a rectangle by drawing four lines: - Line 1: Begin at (0.0, 0.0) and end at (0.375, 0.0). - Line 2: Begin at (0.375, 0.0) and end at (0.375, 0.3697). - Line 3: Begin at (0.375, 0.3697) and end at (0.0, 0.3697). - Line 4: Begin at (0.0, 0.3697) and end at (0.0, 0.0). 3. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.375. 4. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the same coordinate system as set before. 5. Subtract the 3D sketch from Part 1 to result in a new solid body. Part 3: Tapered Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism (Cut) Create a slightly tapered three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly narrower middle section. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other. The sides of the prism are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. This part will be integrated into the assembly by cutting a portion from a previously constructed, larger rectangular prism (Part 1). The dimensions of the resulting solid body will be 0.75 units x 0.4134 units x 0.75 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following orientation and position: - Euler Angles: (180.0, 0.0, -90.0) - Translation Vector: (0.75, 0.75, 0.0) Use the same method as in Parts 1 and 2, but with the mentioned dimensions, orientation, and position. The tapered shape will result from the combination of the specified coordinate system, sketch parameters, and subtractive boolean operation.</description>",
