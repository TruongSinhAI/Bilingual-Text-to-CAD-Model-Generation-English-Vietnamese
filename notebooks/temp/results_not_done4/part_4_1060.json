It has the following dimensions: * Length: 0.75 units * Width: 0.1462 units * Height: 0.75 units Now, repeat the process for the subsequent parts, following the same structure and principles laid out above. Make sure to take into account the adjustments needed in terms of coordinate systems, sketch elements, and boolean operations as you progress to each new part. Remember to describe the shapes, sketch curves, and loops in detail as you go along, while avoiding any specific boolean operation terminology. This will ensure that the junior CAD designer can accurately generate the required CAD models. **Construct a rectangular prism with flat top and bottom, and a sloped side.
