    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Simple, Rounded, and Elongated Shape with a Flat Base Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0868, 0.0868, 0.0] This will be the base for the first part of our assembly. Next, let's create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. This sketch will consist of a single face (face_1) with two lines (line_1 and line_2) and two arcs (arc_1 and arc_2) in the following order: 1. Start by drawing a line (line_1) from the point [0.0, 0.1572] to the point [0.1572, 0.0]. 2. Continue by drawing an arc (arc_1) that starts at the endpoint of line_1, has a midpoint at [0.5764, 0.0], and ends at the point [0.5764, 0.4192]. 3. Draw the next line (line_2) from the endpoint of arc_1 to the point [0.4192, 0.5764]. 4. Complete the loop by drawing the final arc (arc_2), starting at the endpoint of line_2, with a midpoint at [0.0, 0.5764], and ending at the point [0.0, 0.1572]. This loop forms a closed shape, as required by the constraints mentioned earlier. At this stage, you will need to scale the 2D sketch using the scaling parameter provided in the \"extrusion\" key of the CAD assembly JSON: - sketch_scale: 0.5764 After scaling, proceed to transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the given euler angles and translation vector. Now, extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction to generate the 3D model for part_1.

Next, let's create the 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. This sketch will consist of a single face (face_1) with two lines (line_1 and line_2) and two arcs (arc_1 and arc_2) in the following order: 1. Start by drawing a line (line_1) from the point [0.0, 0.1572] to the point [0.1572, 0.0]. 2. Continue by drawing an arc (arc_1) that starts at the endpoint of line_1, has a midpoint at [0.5764, 0.0], and ends at the point [0.5764, 0.4192]. 3. Draw the next line (line_2) from the endpoint of arc_1 to the point [0.4192, 0.5764]. 4.

However, the description specifies a \"\n        , \"Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the following Euler angles and translation vector: Euler angles: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0); Translation vector: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).\"\n        , \". This transformation applies to the resulting 3D sketch/body. The JSON defines the \"\n        , \"coordinate_system\"\n        , \" for \"\n        , \"part_1\"\n        , \" as \"\n        , \"Euler Angles:[-90.0,0.0,-90.0],\"\n        , \"Translation Vector:[0.9231,0.0,0.021]\"\n        , \". These two sets of coordinate system values are different. This is a direct contradiction in the spatial positioning/orientation, leading to a mismatch.Part 2: The coordinate system, sketch circle details for each face, extrusion parameters, and operation match the JSON. However, the description states \"\n        , \"The sketch contains three faces\"\n        , \" at the beginning of the sketch section, but then proceeds to explicitly list \"\n        , \"Face 1\"\n        , \" through \"\n        , \"Face 4\"\n        , \". The JSON clearly has four faces (\"\n        , \"face_1\"\n        , \" to \"\n        , \"face_4\"\n        , \"). This is a contradiction within the description regarding the number of faces, and a mismatch with the JSON's actual face count. Similar to Part 1, the description mentions a 3D sketch transformation using a translation vector of \"\n        , \"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\"\n        , \" while the \"\n        , \"part_2\"\n        , \" coordinate system has a \"\n        , \"Translation Vector:[0.1441,0.0,0.0308]\"\n        , \". This is another mismatch.Correction: Due to the conflicting coordinate system transformations described for Part 1 and Part 2 versus their JSON definitions, and the incorrect face count mentioned for Part 2 in the description, the validation is \"\n        , \"No\"\n        , \".</think>"
