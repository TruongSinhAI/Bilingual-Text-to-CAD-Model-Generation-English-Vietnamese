The prism is slightly tilted to the right. **Step 1: Create and position the coordinate system** Begin by creating a new coordinate system at the origin, with no rotation (Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]) and no translation (Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]). **Step 2: Sketch the base face** Create a new sketch on the XY plane. In the sketch, create five lines: 1. Line 1: Begin at (0.0, 0.0) and end at (0.0428, 0.0) 2. Line 2: Begin at (0.0428, 0.0) and end at (0.0428, 0.0461) 3.

Line 5: Begin at (0.0, 0.0958) and end at (0.0, 0.0) This completes the rectangular base face. **Step 3: Sketch the vertical faces** Now, create four sketches, each on a separate plane perpendicular to the edges of the base face. For each sketch, create loops that follow the edge of the base face, and then extend those loops vertically using parallel lines. The loops and lines should be created as follows: 1. Face 2, Loop 1: Begin at the point (0.0428, 0.0958) on the base face, and create lines to the points (0.3125, 0.0958), (0.3553, 0.0958), (0.3553, 0.177), (0.2953, 0.177), (0.2578, 0.1395), (0.2203, 0.177), (0.135, 0.177), (0.0975, 0.1395), (0.06, 0.177), (0.0, 0.177), and finally back to (0.0428, 0.0958). **Step 4: Sketch the top face** Create a new sketch on the plane perpendicular to the Z-axis at Z = 0.75. In the sketch, create a loop with five straight lines: 1. Line 1: Begin at (0.0428, 0.0) and end at (0.0826, 0.0) 2. Line 2: Begin at (0.0826, 0.0) and end at (0.0826, 0.0461) 3.

This part has a length of 0.25, a width of 0.25, and a height of 0.0938. Its shape is a rectangular prism with rounded corners and edges and four holes on the top and bottom faces. Part 2: A cylindrical object with a tapered end Construct a cylindrical object with a tapered end. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the Euler angles set to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector set to [0.375, 0.0938, 0.0156]. 1. Sketch: a. Face 1: i. Loop 1: 1. Circle 1: - Center: [0.0312, 0.0312] - Radius: 0.0312 2. Extrusion: Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.1875 with the same depth in the opposite direction. Scale the sketch by 0.0625 and set the \"operation\" to \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\". This part has a length of 0.375, a width of 0.0625, and a height of 0.0625. Its shape is a cylindrical object with a tapered end, resembling a metallic tube or pipe.</description>",
