Sketch the loop as a continuous outline, ensuring that the lines and arcs form a closed shape. Scaling Scale the sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. Transformation Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the Euler angles and translation vector specified in the coordinate system. Extrusion Extrude the scaled and transformed 2D sketch along the Z-axis to create the final 3D shape. The extrude depth towards the normal direction should be 0.0938 units, and the extrude depth in the opposite normal direction should be 0 units. The final height of the sloped rectangular prism is 0.75 units. This completes the construction of Part 1, a sloped rectangular prism. The part has a uniform height, width, and length, as follows: * Height: 0.75 units * Width: 0.0938 units * Length: 0.75 units Continue with the instructions for the remaining parts and the final shape as needed.</description>",
