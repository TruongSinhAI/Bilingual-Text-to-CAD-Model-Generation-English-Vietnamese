This will position and orient the sketch plane for the first part. **1.2 Sketch** Now, we'll create the sketch for the top face of the part. 1. Draw a circle at the coordinates (0.0849, 0.085) with a radius of 0.0849. This represents the first face of the top and creates loop_1. We'll repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining three faces along the X-axis, always starting the circle at X = 0.0849 and incrementing by 0.1934: 2. Face_2: Draw a circle at the coordinates (0.2783, 0.085) with a radius of 0.085. 3. Face_3: Draw a circle at the coordinates (0.4716, 0.085) with a radius of 0.085. 4. Face_4: Draw a circle at the coordinates (0.665, 0.085) with a radius of 0.085. These four circles make up the entire diameter of the top face of the part. **1.3 Extrusion** Lastly, define the extrusion: 1. Set the extrude depth towards the normal as 0.0716 and the extrude depth opposite normal as 0 to create the vertical sections connecting the top and bottom circular faces. 2. Use a 0.75 scaling factor and apply the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" extrusion operation to create the final part. The dimensions for this intermediate part are: - Length: 0.75 (diameter of the top circular face) - Width: 0.0716 (height of the vertical sections) - Height: 0.75 (full height of the part) This completes the instructions for the first part. Proceed to the next part using the same naming convention and referencing the provided JSON data.</description>",
