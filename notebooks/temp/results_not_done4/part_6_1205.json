Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 3. Create a rectangle by drawing four lines with the following properties: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.375], End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.75] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.375] 4. Scale the 2D sketch by 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. 5. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the coordinate system information. 6. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.1875 units in the positive Z direction. Part 2: Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. 1. Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.1875] 2. Draw a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 3.

Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.375 units in the positive Z direction. Note: The final 3D model will be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly angled front face. The length will be approximately 2 units, the width 3 units, and the height 4 units. The front face is slightly tilted compared to the base. The first part adds a small rectangular protrusion in the middle of the base, while the second part creates an angled front face.</description>",
