This sketch forms a rectangle on the XY plane. **Step 3: Draw Sketch on Face\\\\_2** Repeat step 2 on the new XZ plane. This results in a rectangle on the XZ plane, aligned with the Y axis. **Step 4: Scale Sketches** Scale the sketches on both faces by a factor of 0.75. **Step 5: Extrude Sketches** Extrude the first sketch on Face\\\\_1 by 0.1344 in the positive Z direction and the second sketch on Face\\\\_2 by 0.1344 in the positive Y direction. This forms the final part shape, a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. **Additional Information** - Shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The prism is centered on a vertical axis. - Length: 0.75 (width of the prism on the XY plane) - Width: 0.1344 (height of the prism on the XZ plane due to the taper) - Height: 0.75 (height of the prism on the positive Z axis)</description>",

Extrude the sketch to generate the 3D model. Use an extrude depth towards the normal of 0.0696 and an extrude depth opposite the normal of 0.0. Apply the scaling parameter \"sketch\\\\_scale\" as 0.7381. The boolean operation for this part is to create a new solid body. The length of this part is 0.7381, and the width is the same. The height is 0.0696. Now that the first part is complete, proceed with constructing the remaining parts, following the same format and instructions as provided above.
