Sketching the top face of the prism: On the XY plane, draw a rectangle defined by the following lines: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.45, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.45, 0.0], End Point [0.45, 0.75] * Line 3: Start Point [0.45, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This is your first loop, consisting of 4 lines. The rectangle should have a width of 0.45 units and a length of 0.75 units. Next, draw a circle centered at [0.225, 0.375] with a radius of 0.075 units.

Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system defined earlier. Extruding the 3D model: Extrude the sketch by 0.03 units along the positive Z direction (towards the normal). This will create a 3D solid model of the rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. Part 2: Construct a slightly tapered cylindrical object. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and a translation vector of [0.15, 0.3, 0.03]. This will position the cylindrical object at a slight angle to the viewer. Sketching the top face of the cylindrical object: On the XY plane, draw a circle defined by the following: * Circle 1: Center [0.075, 0.075], Radius 0.075 The circle should have a diameter of 0.15 units. Creating the 3D sketch: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the coordinate system defined earlier. Extruding the 3D model: Extrude the sketch by 0.03 units along the negative Z direction (opposite the normal). This will create a 3D solid model of the slightly tapered cylindrical object.
