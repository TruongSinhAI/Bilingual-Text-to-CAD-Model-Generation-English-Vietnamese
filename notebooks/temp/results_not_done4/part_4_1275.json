This will create a solid rectangular prism with the specified 2D sketch as its base. **Step 6: Add a smaller prism to the base prism** Create a new coordinate system similar to the first one but with a different translation vector, such as [0.1, 0.25, 0.0]. Sketch a smaller prism on the XY plane, with dimensions 0.0625 by 0.0625. Extrude this sketch by 0.0625 units to create the small attached prism. **Step 7: Position the small prism in relation to the base prism** Move the small prism along the Z-axis to the desired height. The orientation of the small prism can be adjusted by changing the Euler angles. **Step 8 (Final): Combine the base and small prisms** Use a \"JoinFeatureOperation\" (without using the given term) to combine the base prism and the small prism into a single composite solid.

Finally, describe the finished shape: - Shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a curved top and a flat bottom. - Length: 0.75 m - Width: 0.2934 m - Height: 0.3054 m The first part is now complete. Additional Info The CAD Assembly JSON provided offers information about a final shape and parts needed to construct the final shape. Each part is a parametric CAD model comprising three main components: coordinate system, sketch, and extrusion. The coordinate system orients the part in 3D space, while the sketch, drawn on a plane in the coordinate system, is created by combining faces, and each face consists of multiple loops formed by curves such as line, arc, and circle. The extrusion process ultimately transforms the 2D sketch into a 3D model. The CAD Assembly JSON also includes descriptions for the final shape and its parts. By combining multiple parts, it is possible to build the final shape. The instructions provided here created the first part. Following a similar process, you may create more parts and use the operation property from the extrusion component to Boolean operations (cutting, adding, intersecting) with previous parts. For more information, see the table below: Component | Property | Description | | coordinate\\\\_system | euler\\\\_angle | 3D rotation of the 2D sketch plane coordinate\\\\_system | translation\\\\_vector | Translation of the 2D sketch plane sketch | face | Multiple faces can compose a single 2D sketch face | loop | A loop is a closed chain of curves (line, arc, circle) on a single face loop | line/arc/circle | Curve types used in loops extrusion | extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal | Amount of extrusion along normal extrusion | extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal| Amount of extrusion towards the opposite side extrusion | sketch\\\\_scale | Scaling amount for the sketch description | shape | Shape description, such as \"rectangular prism\" description | length/width/height | Dimensions of the part operation | NewBodyFeatureOperation | Creates a new solid body operation | JoinFeatureOperation | Adds materials operation | CutFeatureOperation | Cuts or removes materials operation | IntersectFeatureOperation | Intersects with an existing body and the result is the intersecting volume</description>",
