    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Cylindrical Object Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. The object has a reflective surface and appears to be made of a shiny material. It is symmetrical along its central axis and has a height of 0.6356 units, a length of 1.5 units, and a width of 1.5 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) * Translation Vector: (-0.244, 0.0, 0.6356) Next, create a sketch on the X-Y plane. The sketch will have one face (face\\\\_1) and one loop (loop\\\\_1), which will contain one circle (circle\\\\_1). The circle is centered at (0.75, 0.75) and has a radius of 0.75 units. Now, extrude the sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 0.6356 units, using the following parameters: * extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal: 0.0 * extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal: 0.6356 * sketch\\\\_scale: 1.5 This completes the creation of the cylindrical object. Part 2: Rectangular Prism with Cylindrical Hole Create a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides of the prism are parallel and meet at right angles with the following dimensions: * length (x-axis): 0.7472 units * width (y-axis): 1.0881 units * height (z-axis): 0.7472 units The prism is symmetrical along both the horizontal and vertical axes and has a cylindrical hole in the center along the vertical axis. To create this shape, begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.75, -0.0879) Next, create a sketch on the X-Y plane. The sketch will have one face (face\\\\_1) and one loop (loop\\\\_1), which will contain three lines. The lines represent the outer edges of the rectangular prism as follows: * line\\\\_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.1528), End Point (0.7473, 0.0) * line\\\\_2: Start Point (0.7473, 0.0), End Point (0.506, 0.7236) * line\\\\_3: Start Point (0.506, 0.7236), End Point (0.0, 0.1528) Now, extrude the sketch along the Z-axis to a depth of 1.0882 units using the following parameters: * extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal: 1.0882 * extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal: 0.0 * sketch\\\\_scale: 0.7473 Finally, intersect the newly created body with the cylindrical object from part 1, aligning them along the Z-axis. This will create a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center, which is the final shape described in the prompt.</description>",
