This will serve as the reference frame for the entire part. **Create the Sketch** Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. 1. Draw a line from the origin (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.0147, 0.0). 2. Draw a line from (0.0147, 0.0) to (0.0147, 0.2721). 3. Draw a line from (0.0147, 0.2721) to (0.75, 0.2721). 4. Draw a line from (0.75, 0.2721) to (0.75, 0.2868). 5. Draw a line from (0.75, 0.2868) to (0.0147, 0.2868). 6. Draw a line from (0.0147, 0.2868) to (0.0147, 0.5588). 7. Draw a line from (0.0147, 0.5588) to (0.0, 0.5588). 8. Draw a line from (0.0, 0.5588) to (0.0, 0.0). The sketch should now form a tapered rectangle. The dimensions of the sketch have been provided in the description as length: 0.75, width: 0.75, and height: 0.2647. **Extrude the Sketch** Extrude the sketch along the positive Z-axis (towards the normal direction) by a depth of 0.2647 units. No extrusion is required in the opposite direction of the normal. Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch during the extrusion. The final shape produced should be a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a tapered end, resembling a simplified representation of a building or structure. This concludes the construction of part 1.</description>",
