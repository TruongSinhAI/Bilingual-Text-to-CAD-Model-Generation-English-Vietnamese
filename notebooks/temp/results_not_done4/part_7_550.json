In Loop 1, create Line 1 with a start point at (0, 0) and an end point at (0.1719, 0.0). 2. Create Line 2 with a start point at (0.1719, 0.0) and an end point at (0.1719, 0.1719). 3. Create Line 3 with a start point at (0.1719, 0.1719) and an end point at (0.0, 0.1719). 4. Create Line 4 with a start point at (0.0, 0.1719) and an end point at (0.0, 0.0). 3. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.1719. 4. Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.25 units, using the Join Body Operation. Note: The final shape is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom, a smooth surface, and appears to be a solid, three-dimensional shape. It is symmetrical along its central axis. The length is 0.75, the width is 0.75, and the height is 0.5.</description>",
