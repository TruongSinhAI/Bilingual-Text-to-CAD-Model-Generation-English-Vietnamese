The sketch contains one loop and four lines: * Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.3182, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point = [0.3182, 0.0], End Point = [0.3182, 0.3182] * Line 3: Start Point = [0.3182, 0.3182], End Point = [0.0, 0.3182] * Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.3182], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Close the loop. The loop forms a rectangle. Scale the 2D sketch by the factor 0.3182. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and translation vector [0.0227, 0.0682, 0.2273]. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.5227 units along the normal vector. </description> <valid>Yes</valid> <think> ***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description: parts: The description clearly defines \"\n        , \"Part 1\"\n        , \" and \"\n        , \"Part 2\"\n        , \"\", \" so we expect \"\n        , \"part_1\"\n        , \" and \"\n        , \"part_2\"\n        , \" objects. part_1: (Three-dimensional rectangular prism) -coordinate_system: --Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\"\n        , \") --Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\"\n        , \") -sketch: --face_1: (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Draw a 2D sketch on face 1\"\n        , \") ---loop_1: (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"The sketch contains one loop and four lines\"\n        , \") ----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.3636, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.3636, 0.0]\"\n        , \") ----line_2: Start [0.3636, 0.0], End [0.3636, 0.4545] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Line 2: Start Point = [0.3636, 0.0], End Point = [0.3636, 0.4545]\"\n        , \") ----line_3: Start [0.3636, 0.4545], End [0.0, 0.4545] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Line 3: Start Point = [0.3636, 0.4545], End Point = [0.0, 0.4545]\"\n        , \") ----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.4545], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.4545], End Point = [0.0, 0.0]\"\n        , \") -extrusion: --extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.2273 (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.2273 units along the normal vector\"\n        , \") --extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred as not specified, usually default 0) --sketch_scale: 0.4545 (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Scale the 2D sketch by the factor 0.4545\"\n        , \") --operation: \"\n        , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n        , \" (Inferred as it's the first part) part_2: (Three-dimensional rectangular prism) -coordinate_system: --Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\"\n        , \") --Translation Vector: [0.0227, 0.0682, 0.2273] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Translation Vector: [0.0227, 0.0682, 0.2273]\"\n        , \") -sketch: --face_1: (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Draw a 2D sketch on face 1\"\n        , \") ---loop_1: (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"The sketch contains one loop and four lines\"\n        , \") ----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.3182, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.3182, 0.0]\"\n        , \") ----line_2: Start [0.3182, 0.0], End [0.3182, 0.3182] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Line 2: Start Point = [0.3182, 0.0], End Point = [0.3182, 0.3182]\"\n        , \") ----line_3: Start [0.3182, 0.3182], End [0.0, 0.3182] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Line 3: Start Point = [0.3182, 0.3182], End Point = [0.0, 0.3182]\"\n        , \") ----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.3182], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.3182], End Point = [0.0, 0.0]\"\n        , \") -extrusion: --extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.5227 (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.5227 units along the normal vector\"\n        , \") --extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Inferred as not specified, usually default 0) --sketch_scale: 0.3182 (Derived from description: \"\n        , \"Scale the 2D sketch by the factor 0.3182\"\n        , \") --operation: \"\n        , \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\"\n        , \" (Inferred as it's described as a new part with its own coordinate system) ***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1: -
