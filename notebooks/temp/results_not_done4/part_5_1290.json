Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.3855. 2. Extrude the 2D sketch along its normal direction by 0 units, and in the opposite direction by 0.7189 units to create a cutout for part 2. This part is an inner section of the cylindrical object, having a length of 0.3855, width of 0.3855, and height of 0.7189 units. This part is created by cutting material from part 1. **Final Shape: Cylindrical Object with a Slightly Tapered Top and Bottom** 1. Combine part 1 and part 2 using the appropriate Boolean operation to form the final shape. The final shape is a cylindrical object with a slightly tapered top and bottom, and it has a smooth surface. It is a solid, three-dimensional shape, and it is symmetrical along the central axis. The dimensions of this shape are determined by the dimensions described in part 1 and part 2.
