Create line 4 with start point at [0, 0.75] and end point at [0, 0]. The loop is closed and the sketch is complete. Extrusion: Extrude the sketch towards the positive normal direction by a depth of 0.163 units. Extrude the sketch in the opposite direction of normal with a depth of 0 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Set the sketch scale as the sketch scale for the extrusion. The extrusion is complete. Part 2: Construct a smaller rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. Create a new coordinate system with zero rotation, and a translation vector of [0.2517, 0.0601, 0.163]. Sketch: Create a new sketch on face 1 of the coordinate system.

Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.6298. Set the sketch scale as the sketch scale for the extrusion. The extrusion is complete. Final Shape: The final shape is the combination of the two extruded parts. Part 1 is added to the existing model, and part 2 is subtracted from the existing model, creating a stepped appearance. The length and width of the final shape are 3 units each, and the height is 1 unit (including the tapered middle section). The final shape is centered on a white background. The final shape can be described as a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section, where the front and back faces are parallel to each other and the side faces are perpendicular.</description>",
