The final shape of the first part should be a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a tapered top and a flat bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, while the sides are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The top and bottom faces are of equal size, and the sides are of equal length. The tapered top is narrower than the bottom face. The length, width, and height of this part are 0.75, 0.4737, and 0.4737 units, respectively.</description>",
