Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch by applying the coordinate system parameters. Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0.1875 inches toward the normal and 0.1875 inches away from the normal to create the 3D model. This part is a hollow cylinder, resembling the final shape described in the JSON input. **Part 2: Creating the Cylindrical Body** (Note: This example assumes the existence of a Part 1, which is a rounded rectangular base.) Begin by creating a new coordinate system for Part 2: - Euler Angles: (0.0, 90.0, 0.0) - Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) Create a circular sketch in the X-Y plane defined by the coordinate system: - Circle 1: - Center: (0.0, 0.0) - Radius: 0.375 Scale the sketch to 0.45 with the scaling factor. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch by applying the coordinate system parameters. Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0.45 in the positive Z direction to create a new body representing the CAD assembly's cylindrical body. Next, perform the appropriate boolean operation between Part 2 and Part 1 to combine them, creating an intersecting body that leaves only the originally described cylindrical CAD model with a hollow center. The height of the final shape is equal to the heights of Part 1 and Part 2 combined. - Final Height: 0.45 + 0.45 = 0.9 By following these instructions, a junior CAD designer will be able to create an accurate CAD model based on the provided JSON file.</description>",
