The center of the circle should be located at 0.375, 0.375 and the radius should be 0.375. After you have created the 2D sketch, scale it using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.3 and an extrusion depth opposite the normal of 0.0. The sketch scale should be 0.75. Use a NewBodyFeatureOperation to create the final shape. The final shape of part 1 is a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. The height of the cylinder is approximately three times its diameter. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. The length, width, and height of the part are 0.75, 0.75, and 0.3 respectively. **Part 2: Cylindrical Object with a Tapered Top and Bottom** Create a new coordinate system for part 2 with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector 0.285, 0.285, 0.3. Sketch the first face (face\\\\_1) of part 2. On this face, create a loop (loop\\\\_1) and within this loop, create a circle (circle\\\\_1). The center of the circle should be located at 0.09, 0.09 and the radius should be 0.09. After you have created the 2D sketch, scale it using a scaling parameter of 0.18. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using euler angles 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.225 and an extrusion depth opposite the normal of 0.0. The sketch scale should be 0.18.

The object has a reflective surface. The length, width, and height of the part are 0.18, 0.18, and 0.225 respectively.</description>",
