The cylindrical hole is centered along the length of the prism. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 10 units long, 5 units wide, and 2 units tall. The cylindrical hole has a diameter of about 3 units. 1. **Coordinate System**: Set the euler angles to (0, 0, 0) and the translation vector to (0, 0, 0). 2. **Sketch**: On the XY plane, create a rectangle with corners at (0, 0) and (0.75, 0.75). Divide the rectangle into 4 lines: - Line 1: From (0, 0) to (0.75, 0). - Line 2: From (0.75, 0) to (0.75, 0.75). - Line 3: From (0.75, 0.75) to (0, 0.75). - Line 4: From (0, 0.75) to (0, 0). Add a circle to the sketch with center at (0.375, 0.375) and radius of 0.3319. This will create a cylindrical hole in the prism.
