    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom The first part is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. This part is constructed by creating a new coordinate system, generating a 2D sketch, scaling the sketch, transforming it into a 3D sketch, and finally, extruding the sketch to create the 3D model. To create this part, follow these steps: 1. **Create a new coordinate system** For this part, the Euler angles are 0°, 0°, and 0°, and the translation vector is [0, 0, 0]. This places the coordinate system at the origin with no rotation. 2. **Generate a 2D sketch** Sketch a rectangle on the XY plane. Divide the rectangle into two parts of equal width by drawing a horizontal line at 75% of the rectangle's height. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the loops and faces involved in the sketch: - **Face 1** - **Loop 1** (clockwise) - Line 1: From [0, 0] to [0.3333, 0] - Line 2: From [0.3333, 0] to [0.3333, 0.75] - Line 3: From [0.3333, 0.75] to [0, 0.75] - Line 4: From [0, 0.75] to [0, 0] 3. **Scale the 2D sketch** Apply scaling of 0.75 to the sketch. This will result in a smaller rectangle. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** For extrusion purposes, rotate the sketch around all three axes using the Euler angles defined in the coordinate system (0°, 0°, 0°) and keeping the translation vector as [0, 0, 0]. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch** Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis to create the 3D model. Set the 'extrude\\_depth\\_towards\\_normal' parameter of the extrusion feature to 0.0156, and the 'extrude\\_depth\\_opposite\\_normal' parameter to 0. The resulting part is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Its length, width, and height, as per the description, are approximately 0.75 units, 0.75 units, and 0.0156 units, respectively. Continue on to generating instructions for subsequent parts, following the given instructions and the provided JSON.</description>",
