Begin by creating a circle on the XY plane with its center at (0.0234, 0.3027) and a radius of 0.0234. This circle forms face_1. 2. Create another circle on the XY plane with its center at (0.0397, 0.1641) and a radius of 0.0234. This circle forms face_2. 3. Create a circle on the XY plane with its center at (0.0496, 0.4518) and a radius of 0.0234. This circle forms face_3. Creating the Holes: 1. On face_4, draw two arcs: - Arc 1: Start at (0.1544, 0.0131), with a midpoint at (0.1988, 0.0448), and end at (0.2431, 0.0131). - Arc 2: Start at (0.2431, 0.0131), with a midpoint at (0.1988, 0.5956), and end at (0.1544, 0.0131). 2. Ensure that the arcs create a closed loop_1. 3. Draw another set of arcs on face_4, in a counterclockwise direction: - Arc 1: Start at (0.1637, 0.0), with a midpoint at (0.1988, 0.0331), and end at (0.2339, 0.0). - Arc 2: Start at (0.2339, 0.0), with a midpoint at (0.1988, 0.6073), and end at (0.1637, 0.0). 4. Create a closed loop_2 with these arcs. Finalizing the Base: 1. Create circle_1 on face_5 with its center at (0.1988, 0.3027) and a radius of 0.0234. 2. Add a series of short line segments to connect the circle's endpoints, creating an equilateral polygon inside face_5. 3. Create circle_1 on face_6 with its center at (0.1988, 0.5136) and a radius of 0.0234. 4. Create circle_1 on face_7 with its center at (0.3479, 0.4519) and a radius of 0.0234. 5. Create circle_1 on face_8 with its center at (0.3581, 0.1644) and a radius of 0.0234. 6. Create circle_1 on face_9 with its center at (0.3752, 0.3027) and a radius of 0.0234. Part 2: Creating a Rectangular Prism with a Centered Circular Hole 1. Start by creating a coordinate system aligning with the global referential. 2. Sketch a rectangle on the XY plane with its corners at (0.0, 0.0) and (0.75, 0.6866), which forms face_1. 3. Draw a circle centered at (0.375, 0.3433) with a radius of 0.0406, which intersects the rectangle. Cut everything outside the circle. 4. Scale the resulting 3D geometry by a factor of 0.75.
