Radius of 0.0692 Extrude Sketch Extrude the sketch along the normal vector by 0.0443 units and in the opposite direction by 0 units. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75 before extrusion. This creates a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. Part 2: Second Part Create Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system based on the previous one. Keep the euler angles at 0 degrees in all axes. Set the translation vector to (0.1921, 0.0166, 0.0443). Create Sketch Create a new sketch on the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system.
