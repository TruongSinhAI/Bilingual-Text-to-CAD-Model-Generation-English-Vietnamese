Draw the 2D sketch Next, create a new sketch on the 2D sketch plane defined by the coordinate system. Face 1 Create a loop, named loop\\\\_1, on the sketch plane, and add four lines to it: 1. line\\\\_1: Connect the points (0.0, 0.0) and (0.4633, 0.0). 2. line\\\\_2: Connect the points (0.4633, 0.0) and (0.4633, 0.75). 3. line\\\\_3: Connect the points (0.4633, 0.75) and (0.0, 0.75). 4. line\\\\_4: Connect the points (0.0, 0.75) and (0.0, 0.0). This loop, loop\\\\_1, is the outline of the rectangular prism. Loop 2 (Circular Cutout 1) Create a new loop, named loop\\\\_2, and add a circle to it using the circle tool. Set the circle's center to (0.128, 0.128) and its radius to 0.0621. This will create the first circular cutout of the rectangular prism. Loop 3 (Circular Cutout 2) Create a new loop, named loop\\\\_3, and draw a rectangle on the sketch plane with the following four points: (0.1837, 0.2944), (0.2797, 0.2944), (0.2797, 0.4185), and (0.1837, 0.4185). Divide this rectangle into four lines as described and add them to this loop. This loop, loop\\\\_3, is the outline of the second circular cutout. Loop 4 (Circular Cutout 3) Create a new loop, named loop\\\\_4, and add a circle to it using the circle tool. Set the circle's center to (0.3353, 0.128) and its radius to 0.0621.

Once completed, you will have created a 3D model of a rectangular prism with three circular cutouts on its surface.
