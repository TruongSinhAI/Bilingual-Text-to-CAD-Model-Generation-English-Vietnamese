Draw line4 from the endpoint of arc4 [0.0, 0.7241] to the start point [0.0, 0.0259]. Step 4: Scale and Extrude the Sketch 1. Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. 2. Extrude the sketch along the positive Z-axis by 0.0457 units. Description This part is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a curved side measuring 0.75 units in length and width, and 0.0457 units in height. The prism's flat surfaces are parallel to the X-Y plane, and the curved surface is at the corner connecting the top and bottom surfaces. The sketch consists of 4 lines and 4 arcs forming a single loop that is anticlockwise and closed. The loop spans from the bottom-left corner point [0, 0.0259] counterclockwise to the endpoint [0.0259, 0] of arc1, which connects to line1 that leads to point [0.3473, 0]. Continuing counterclockwise, arc2 connects to line2 at point [0.3732, 0.0259], which further leads to point [0.3732, 0.7241] through arc3, line3, and arc4. Finally, line4 connects the endpoint [0.0259, 0.75] of arc4 back to the start point [0, 0.0259]. The loop is constrained to be closed, ensuring the shape is a single volume. Other constraints should be applied to ensure the curved side is tangent to the corresponding top and bottom edges.</description>",
