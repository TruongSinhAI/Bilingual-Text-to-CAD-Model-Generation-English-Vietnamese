Creating the Coordinate System 1. Create a new coordinate system for part 1. 2. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]. 3. Set the translation vector to [0.0, 0.4125, 0.0]. Drawing the 2D Sketch 1. On the X-Y plane of the new coordinate system, draw a rectangle with the following dimensions: - Corner point 1: [0.0, 0.0] - Corner point 2: [0.75, 0.0] - Corner point 3: [0.75, 0.5] - Corner point 4: [0.0, 0.5] 2. Draw a circle centered at [0.1562, 0.25] with a radius of 0.095. Loops and Curves *Loop 1*: * Curve 1: line from [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] * Curve 2: line from [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.5] * Curve 3: line from [0.75, 0.5] to [0.0, 0.5] * Curve 4: line from [0.0, 0.5] to [0.0, 0.0] *Loop 2*: * Curve 1: circle centered at [0.1562, 0.25] with a radius of 0.095 Creating the 3D Sketch 1. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. 2. Transform the 2D sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector. Extruding the 3D Model 1. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal, by a depth of 0.1625. Conclusion After completing these steps, you will have constructed part 1, a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, with the dimensions: - length: 0.75 - width: 0.1625 - height: 0.75 Repeat this process for the subsequent CAD parts listed in the assembly JSON, ensuring that the parts are built upon the previously constructed parts using the defined operation. This will ensure you generate an accurate CAD model, following the provided instructions and JSON structure.</description>",
