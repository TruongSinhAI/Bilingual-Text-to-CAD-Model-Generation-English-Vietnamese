Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the following operations: * Rotate the 2D sketch about the x-axis by 0.0 degrees * Rotate the 2D sketch about the y-axis by 0.0 degrees * Rotate the 2D sketch about the z-axis by -90.0 degrees * Translate the 2D sketch by [0.0031, 0.0911, 0.0] **Step 4: Extrude the 3D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 3D sketch by a depth of 0.0911 towards the normal direction and a depth of 0.0 in the opposite direction. The resulting 3D model is a metallic object with a rectangular shape and two circular holes on opposite sides, with a smooth surface. The length of the intermediate part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.0911 units, and the height is 0.0911 units. The height of the final shape is equal to the length and width, which is 0.75 units. Repeat the above steps for each intermediate part in the CAD assembly JSON. Make sure to use the provided parameters to create the coordinate system, the 2D sketch, and the extrusion. Be precise in your instructions and avoid using any specific boolean operation terms. Use natural language descriptions instead. Keep the instructions clear, concise, and imperative, and use headings, section breaks, and numbered lists to organize the instructions.</description>",
