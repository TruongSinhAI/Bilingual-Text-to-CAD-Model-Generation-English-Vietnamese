The JSON correctly maps these three lines, so the discrepancy is in the description's naming (\"\n                  ,\"rectangle  \"\n                  ,\") rather than the geometric data provided.\\n  - Sketch `face_2.loop_1` (second 2D sketch): The description states \"\n                  ,\"Draw the rectangle boundary  \"\n                  ,\" with \"\n                  ,\"Line 2: Start at `(0.0194, 0.3302)`, End at `(0.1942, 0.3496)`  \"\n                  ,\" AND then explicitly states \"\n                  ,\"Draw a quarter-circle arc: - Arc: Start at `(0.0194, 0.3302)`, Mid at `(0.1074, 0.3351)`, End at `(0.1942, 0.3496)`  \"\n                  ,\" for the *same* segment. The JSON correctly includes an `arc_1` between these points with the specified mid-point, but it does *not* include a `line` for that segment. This is a direct contradiction in the description. The JSON's interpretation of an arc is geometrically more specific and likely correct given the mid-point, but it means the description *as written* (\"\n                  ,\"Line 2  \"\n                  ,\" as part of a rectangle boundary) does not perfectly match the JSON. Hence, the validation is \"\n                  ,\"No  \"\n                  ,\".\\n  - Extrusion parameters (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`) match exactly. The `operation` \"\n                  ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation  \"\n                  ,\" is appropriate for a new base part.\\n\\n- Part 2:\\n  - Coordinate system parameters match exactly.\\n  - Sketch `face_1.loop_1` (rectangle defined by four lines) matches exactly in terms of points and connectivity.\\n  - Extrusion parameters (`extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `sketch_scale`) match. `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` is correctly inferred as 0.0. The `operation` \"\n                  ,\"NewBodyFeatureOperation  \"\n                  ,\" is specified in the JSON and is a valid operation for creating a new independent body, even if it's intended for attachment later.\\n\\n- Correction: The inconsistency in the description for Part 1's second sketch (describing a segment as both a line and an arc) leads to a mismatch with the JSON, which correctly represents it as an arc.\\n</think>"
