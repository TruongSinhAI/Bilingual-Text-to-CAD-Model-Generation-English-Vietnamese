Use the following parameters: Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.0] Now, create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. For this sketch, create two rectangular loops as follows. Loop 1: * Line 1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0], End Point = [0.0772, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point = [0.0772, 0.0], End Point = [0.0772, 0.0772] * Line 3: Start Point = [0.0772, 0.0772], End Point = [0.0, 0.0772] * Line 4: Start Point = [0.0, 0.0772], End Point = [0.0, 0.0] Note that there are multiple lines in this loop. Loop 2: * Line 1: Start Point = [0.0011, 0.0011], End Point = [0.0761, 0.0011] * Line 2: Start Point = [0.0761, 0.0011], End Point = [0.0761, 0.0761] * Line 3: Start Point = [0.0761, 0.0761], End Point = [0.0011, 0.0761] * Line 4: Start Point = [0.0011, 0.0761], End Point = [0.0011, 0.0011] Again, there are multiple lines in this loop. After creating the loops, scale the sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.0772. Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by rotating it around the Z-axis by -90 degrees (using Euler angles) and translating it along the Z-axis by 0.375 (using the translation vector). Extrude the sketch along its normal direction by 0.1875 units, creating a pyramid shape. This operation adds material to the model. The length of the pyramid is 0.0772 units, the width is 0.375 units, and the height is 0.0772 units.</description>",
