Sketching the Base of the Prism Create a new sketch on the XY plane. 1. Draw a rectangle centered at the origin with half-lengths 0.375 and 0.0205 meters, with one vertex at (0.0, 0.0) and the opposite vertex at (0.375, 0.0205). The rectangle should have two lines, one connecting the points (0.0, 0.0) and (0.375, 0.0), and another connecting the points (0.375, 0.0) and (0.375, 0.0205). 2. Constrain the rectangle to be closed and centered at the origin. Scaling the Sketch Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.75. Transforming the Sketch Translate the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0131 meters (half of the taper height) and rotate it 30 degrees around the X-axis. Extruding the Sketch Extrude the sketch to a depth of 0.0261 meters along the positive Z-axis, creating a tapered rectangular prism. This concludes the creation of part 1. The length of this part is 0.2812 meters, the width is 0.2812 meters, and the height is 0.0261 meters. Part 2: Creating a Cylindrical Hole Creating a New Coordinate System Create a new coordinate system with the following values: * Euler angles: [30.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] Sketching a Circle Create a new sketch on a plane perpendicular to the Z-axis and centered at the origin. 1. Draw a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 0.15 meters. 2. Constrain the circle to be centered at the origin and closed. Scaling the Sketch Scale the sketch uniformly by a factor of 0.75. Transforming the Sketch Translate the sketch along the Z-axis by 0.0131 meters (half of the taper height) and rotate it -30 degrees around the X-axis. Extruding the Sketch Extrude the scaled and transformed circle sketch along the Z-axis, creating a cylindrical hole through the prism. The hole should begin at Z = 0.0131 meters and extend to Z = 0.0361 meters with the same radius as the original circle, which is 0.15 meters. This concludes the creation of the cylindrical hole. Final Object Taper the top of the prism by subtracting the volume created by the cylindrical hole starting from the Z = 0.0361 meters to the Z = 0.0414 meters. The final object should now be a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole through its center. Theprism is slightly tapered at the top, as specified in the given JSON data. * The overall length of the final object is 0.2812 meters. * The overall width of the final object is 0.2812 meters. * The overall height of the final object is 0.0414 meters.</description>",
