Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. **Step 2: Create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane** Create a new 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. This sketch will be used to define the shape of part 1. **Step 3: Draw the sketch** Begin by drawing a line from point [0.0, 0.0665] to point [0.1227, 0.0665]. This will form the top edge of the prism. Next, draw a line from point [0.1227, 0.0665] to point [0.1227, 0.0]. This will form the front edge of the prism. Then, draw a line from point [0.1227, 0.0] to point [0.2468, 0.0]. This will form the right edge of the prism. Followed by drawing a line from point [0.2468, 0.0] to point [0.2455, 0.1331]. This will form the bottom edge of the prism. Then, draw a line from point [0.2455, 0.1331] to point [0.0, 0.1331]. This will form the back edge of the prism. Finally, draw a line from point [0.0, 0.1331] to point [0.0, 0.0665]. This will close the loop and form the bottom edge of the prism. The resulting sketch should be a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a tapered middle section. **Step 4: Scale the 2D sketch** Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.2468. This will adjust the size of the prism to the desired dimensions. **Step 5: Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch** Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the same coordinate system as before. **Step 6: Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by a distance of 0.0638. This will create the 3D model of part 1, which is a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, and a slightly tapered middle section. The height of part 1 is 0.0638, the width is 0.2468, and the length is also 0.2468.</description>",
