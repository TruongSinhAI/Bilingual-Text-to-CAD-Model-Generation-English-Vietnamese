Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.15 units towards the normal and 0 units in the opposite direction of normals. Note that this part has a \"height\" of 0.75 units, a \"width\" of 0.75 units, and a \"length\" of 0.15 units. This part represents a prism with the following final shape: * A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. This part will be used as the base for subsequent parts by integrating using the appropriate boolean operation. To integrate this part with preceding CAD models, select the appropriate boolean operation based on the design requirements. Provide a natural language description of the boolean operation instead of using specific terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation', etc. For instance: * If adding material or joining, use 'add' or 'join'. * If removing material or cutting, use 'subtract'. * If intersecting, use 'intersect'. * If creating a new solid body, use 'create a new solid body'. Use clear, concise language with an imperative tone, avoiding unnecessary explanations. By adhering to these instructions, you will facilitate the generation of an accurate CAD model.</description>",
