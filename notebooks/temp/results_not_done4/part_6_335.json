Final shape The final shape is the combination of the three intermediate parts. It is a three-dimensional, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The front face is angled at approximately 45 degrees from the top and bottom faces. The object is centered on a white background. Part 4: Three-dimensional, complete rectangular prism Start by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles set to (0, 45, 0) degrees and a translation vector of (0, 0, 0.5 + 0.35 + 0.07). Sketch For the first face, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane. 1. Draw a rectangle with a width of 0.75 and a height of 0.75. The bottom-left corner of the rectangle should be at the origin (0, 0). Extrude the sketch by a distance of approximately 0.03 along the vector (0, 0, 1). Extrusion 1. Extrude the sketch by a distance of 0.03 towards the normal direction. 2. Do not extrude in the opposite direction. 3. Scale the sketch by a factor of 1. 4. Combine the current part with the previous parts by creating a new solid body. The final shape is a complete rectangular prism, with all six faces parallel to the coordinate axes. The dimensions of the prism are 0.75 units in width, 0.75 units in height, and approximately 1.07 units in length. The front face is angled at approximately 45 degrees from the top and bottom faces, and the object is centered on a white background.</description>",
