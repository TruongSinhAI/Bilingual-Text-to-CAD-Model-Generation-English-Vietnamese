For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and a loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face. Then, add six lines to the loop: * line\\\\_1: Start Point (0.0, 0.033), End Point (0.0571, 0.0) * line\\\\_2: Start Point (0.0571, 0.0), End Point (0.1142, 0.033) * line\\\\_3: Start Point (0.1142, 0.033), End Point (0.1142, 0.0989) * line\\\\_4: Start Point (0.1142, 0.0989), End Point (0.0571, 0.1319) * line\\\\_5: Start Point (0.0571, 0.1319), End Point (0.0, 0.0989) * line\\\\_6: Start Point (0.0, 0.0989), End Point (0.0, 0.033) Next, set the extrusion properties. Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.7359 towards the normal, and 0.0 in the opposite direction. Set the sketch scale to 0.1319. The operation should result in a JoinFeatureOperation. **Part 3: Construct a long, rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom.** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 and translation vector of (0.3177, 0.0194, 0.0). For the sketch, create a new face (face\\\\_1) and a loop (loop\\\\_1) on that face. Then, add six lines to the loop, identical to those in Part 2. Next, set the extrusion properties. Extrude the sketch by a depth of 0.7359 towards the normal, and 0.0 in the opposite direction. Set the sketch scale to 0.1319.
