While for a cut operation, extruding \"\n   ,\"opposite normal\"\n   ,\" is common to cut *into* the body, the description's phrasing \"\n   ,\"along the normal direction\"\n   ,\" can be strictly interpreted as `extrude_depth_towards_normal`. This creates an ambiguity/mismatch in the explicit definition of the extrusion direction versus the JSON's specific assignment.\\n\\n-Correction: Due to the structural mismatch in Part 1's sketch definition (description implies two faces, JSON has one face with two loops) and the ambiguous/misaligned extrusion depth direction for Part 2, the JSON does not perfectly match the description.\\n</think>"
