    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate Part 1 - A Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Flat Top and Bottom** Before proceeding with the instructions, let's examine the dimensions given in the description for part 1: * shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom * length: 0.75 * width: 0.75 * height: 0.0469 The prism has 4 faces, and the bottom face and the top face are rectangular. The top face is a copy of the bottom face, translated along the positive Z-direction (normal direction) by `height (0.0469)`, then scaled by `sketch_scale (0.75)`. To construct part 1: 1. **Create Coordinate System:** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following initial parameters: * Euler Angles: 0° along the X-axis, 0° along the Y-axis, and 0° along the Z-axis * Translation Vector: [0, 0, 0] in the world coordinates 2. **Generate 2D Sketch:** On the X-Y plane of the created coordinate system, draw a closed rectangle using four lines to form a single loop. Specifically: * **Line 1:** Start Point [0, 0], End Point [0.75, 0] * **Line 2:** Start Point [0.75, 0], End Point [0.75, 0.75] * **Line 3:** Start Point [0.75, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] * **Line 4:** Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] 3. **Scale 2D Sketch:** Scale the entire 2D sketch in the X-Y plane by a factor of 0.75. 4. **Transform Sketch to 3D:** Transform the 2D sketch into 3D space by creating a copy of the bottom face and translating it along the Z-axis (normal direction) by `height (0.0469)` and scaling by `sketch_scale (0.75)`. This will generate the top face, and the space between top and bottom faces - the prism. 5. **Extrude Sketch to Form 3D Model:** Extrude the 2D sketch by a specific depth, `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, along its normal vector (Z-direction) to form a three-dimensional shape. By following these steps, you will have constructed part 1, a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Next, follow the instructions for the remaining parts, if provided.</description>",
