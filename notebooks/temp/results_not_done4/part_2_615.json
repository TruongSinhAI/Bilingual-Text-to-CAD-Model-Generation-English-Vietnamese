The top and bottom sections are parallel to each other, while the middle section is perpendicular to both. The top and bottom sections are connected by a straight line, creating a rectangular shape. The middle section is slightly narrower than the top and bottom sections, giving the object a tapered appearance. The length and width of the prism are both 0.75 units, and the height of the part is 0.045 units. *Construction Steps* 1. Create a new coordinate system with euler angles 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and translation vector 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. This will be the base for the first sketch. 2. Draw the first face of the sketch. This face has two loops, loop_1 and loop_2, and a third loop, loop_3. 3. Loop_1 consists of the following curve segments: 1. Arc_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0375], Mid Point [0.011, 0.011], End Point [0.0375, 0.0]. 2. Line_1: Start Point [0.0375, 0.0], End Point [0.1125, 0.0]. 3.

Circle_1: Center [0.1125, 0.375], Radius 0.03. 5. Loop_3 consists of a single circle: 1. Circle_1: Center [0.1125, 0.15], Radius 0.0225. 6. After sketching, scale the sketch by 0.75 using the 'sketch_scale' parameter. 7. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. 8. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.045 units. The extrusion operation is a \"NewBodyFeatureOperation,\" which adds material and creates a new solid body. These instructions should allow the junior CAD engineer to construct the first part of the assembly as described in the given JSON. The instructions are written to avoid using specific boolean operation terms and to provide details for all the curves, loops, and faces required to build the intermediate parts and final shape.</description>",
