Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] degrees and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This sets the orientation and position of the part's coordinate system. For the 2D sketch, draw a rectangle on the XY plane of the coordinate system. The rectangle is defined by four lines as follows: 1. Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.0] 2. Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0], End Point [0.75, 0.75] 3. Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] 4. Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This completes the sketching process. Since the part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners, we need to scale and extrude the 2D sketch to create the 3D model. Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 to obtain the desired dimensions of the part. After scaling: Part dimensions: Length: 0.75 Width: 0.75 Height: Not provided yet Now, create the 3D model by extruding the scaled sketch along its normal vector [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], with an extrusion depth of 0.75 towards the normal. This completes the 3D model of the part. Extrusion parameters: Extrude depth towards normal: 0.75 Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 Sketch scale: 0.75 Operation: New Body Feature (add materials) Perform a New Body Feature operation, which creates a new solid body for the current part. This part is now ready for further processing in the CAD assembly. Completed part: Shape: A three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners Length: 0.75 Width: 0.75 Height: 0.75 (as a result of the extrusion process)</description>",
