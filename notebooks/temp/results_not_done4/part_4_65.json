The first part is a rectangular prism with a curved top edge, which will serve as the base of the final shape. Here's the detailed construction process. **1. Create a new coordinate system:** Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: - Euler Angles: [ -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 ] - Translation Vector: [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] **2. Draw the 2D sketch on the XY plane:** Set the sketch plane to the XY plane, and follow these steps to build the 2D sketch: - Draw the first line segment from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.0833, 0.0). - Draw the second line segment from point (0.0833, 0.0) to point (0.0833, 0.6667). - Draw the third line segment from point (0.0833, 0.6667) to point (0.4133, 0.6667). - Draw the fourth line segment from point (0.4133, 0.6667) to point (0.4133, 0.75). - Draw the fifth line segment from point (0.4133, 0.75) to point (0.0, 0.75). - Close the loop and complete the 2D sketch by drawing a line from point (0.0, 0.75) to point (0.0, 0.0), which coincides with the starting point. **3. Scale the 2D sketch:** Apply a scaling transformation to the 2D sketch with the `sketch_scale` factor: 0.75. **4. Transform the 2D sketch into 3D space:** Use the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system to position the scaled 2D sketch in 3D space. **5. Extrude the 2D sketch:** Create the 3D model by extruding the 2D sketch with a depth of 0.03 units toward the normal, leaving a 0 cm vice-versa depth, and using the NewBodyFeatureOperation. **6. Record the description:** The description of the final part should include the following height, width, and length parameters: - Length: 0.03 - Width: 0.75 - Height: 0.75 Building other parts will follow the same sequence and process. Remember, each part should include a complete 2D sketch defining its shape, a scale factor, a transformation into 3D space, and an extrusion.</description>",
