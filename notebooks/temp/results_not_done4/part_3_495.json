The sketch consists of two faces: face\\\\_1 and face\\\\_2. Face\\\\_1 is a closed loop with four curves, while face\\\\_2 is a circle. For face\\\\_1: - Create line\\\\_1 from point (0.0, 0.0) to point (0.6469, 0.0). - Create line\\\\_2 from point (0.6469, 0.0) to point (0.6469, 0.4266). - Create arc\\\\_1 from point (0.6469, 0.4266) to point (0.3234, 0.1031) to point (0.0, 0.4266).
