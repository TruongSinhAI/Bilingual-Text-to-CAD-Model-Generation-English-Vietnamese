Create a sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch contains one face with one loop. The loop consists of 1. Line 1: Start Point {0.0, 0.0}, End Point {0.75, 0.0} 2.

Line 8: Start Point {0.0, 0.495}, End Point {0.0, 0.0} Scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 3D sketch to a depth of 0.3351 units in the direction of the normal. This results in a 3D model of a rectangular prism with various shapes and features attached to it. The length is approximately 0.75 units, the width is approximately 0.34 units, and the height is approximately 0.75 units. **Part 2** Create a new coordinate system with euler angles {0.0, 0.0, 0.0} and translation vector {0.6043, 0.0944, 0.495}. Create a sketch on a plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch contains one face with one loop. The loop consists of 1. Line 1: Start Point {0.0, 0.0}, End Point {0.1457, 0.0} 2.

Line 4: Start Point {0.0, 0.1485}, End Point {0.0, 0.0} Do not extrude this sketch. Instead, use it to cut into the existing 3D model. This will create a cutout in the shape of a smaller rectangular prism. The cutout has a length of approximately 0.15 units, a width of approximately 0.15 units, and a height of approximately 0.17 units. The final shape is a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a cutout on one side, creating a smaller rectangular prism inside.

    "prompt": "<description>**Instructions for Part 1** Construct a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a smaller rectangular prism on top of it. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. 1. **Define Coordinate System** The euler angles for the coordinate system are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.1312, 0.0]. This configuration defines the orientation and placement of the 2D sketch plane. 2. **Create 2D Sketch** Next, create a 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch is divided into two faces. **Face 1** - Loop 1 - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.1082]; End Point [0.2769, 0.1082] - Line 2: Start Point [0.2769, 0.1082]; End Point [0.2769, 0.4264] - Line 3: Start Point [0.2769, 0.4264]; End Point [0.0, 0.4264] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.4264]; End Point [0.0, 0.1082] **Face 2** - Loop 1 - Line 1: Start Point [0.4871, 0.0]; End Point [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.75, 0.0]; End Point [0.75, 0.3563] - Line 3: Start Point [0.75, 0.3563]; End Point [0.4871, 0.3563] - Line 4: Start Point [0.4871, 0.3563]; End Point [0.4871, 0.0] Note that each loop is a closed sequence of lines. 3. **Scale the 2D Sketch** Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the 2D sketch. This is specified by the `sketch_scale` parameter. 4. **Transform 2D Sketch into 3D Sketch** Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the specified euler angles and translation vector. 5. **Extrude the 2D Sketch to Generate the 3D Model** Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by a depth of 0.1312 units. Additionally, since the `extrude_depth_opposite_normal` value is 0, no extrusion occurs in the opposite direction. 6. **Perform Boolean Operation** Finally, integrate this part with preceding CAD models using the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" (i.e., create a new solid body). Repeat the above steps for any additional parts in the assembly. Dimensions for the intermediate part and the final shape are as follows: - Part 1: length - 0.75 units, width - 0.1312 units, height - 0.75 units - Final shape: length - 0.75 units, width - 0.1312 units, height - 0.75 units Confidence: 90%</description>",
