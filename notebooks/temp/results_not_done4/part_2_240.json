The length of the part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.4688 units, and the height is 0.4688 units. *Step-by-step Instructions* 1. **Create a coordinate system**: Start by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: - Euler Angles: [ -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 ] - Translation Vector: [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] 2. **Create the 2D sketch**: Switch to the sketching environment and create a new sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Keep this sketch open for now. In the sketch, you will create two loops, one for the outer circle and one for the inner circle, representing the hollow center. **Loop 1: Outer Circle** 1. **Create Circle 1**: Create a circle with its center at [ 0.2344, 0.2344 ] and a radius of 0.2344 units. **Loop 2: Inner Circle** 1. **Create Circle 2**: Create a circle with its center at [ 0.2344, 0.2344 ] and a radius of 0.125 units. Now, you will transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using scaling and euler angles. 3. **Transform the 2D sketch into the 3D sketch**: - Scale the sketch by the scaling parameter 0.4688. - Apply the following Euler angles [ -90.0, 0.0, -90.0 ] for the 3D rotation of the 2D sketch plane. - Set the translation vector to [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]. Next, you will extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. 4. **Extrude the 2D sketch**: - Extrude the sketch by 0.75 units in the positive Z-direction (towards the normal). - Set the opposite direction of the normal extrusion to 0.0 units. In this final step, you have created an intermediate CAD part based on the initial JSON configuration. Now move on to any additional parts and follow the same sequence of steps as you proceed. This will help you create the final CAD assembly as required.</description>",
