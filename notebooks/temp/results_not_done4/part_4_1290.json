    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top and Bottom The first part is a rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. The top and bottom faces are parallel to each other, and the sides are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces. The top and bottom faces are flat, and the sides have a slight curve. We will begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following parameters: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.45, 0.0] Next, we will create the 2D sketch for this part on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of a single face (face\\\\_1) with a closed loop (loop\\\\_1) that defines the perimeter of the part. The loop consists of the following lines and curves: * Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.1125, 0.0] * Line 2: Start Point [0.1125, 0.0], End Point [0.1125, 0.75] * Line 3: Start Point [0.1125, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] * Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.6] * Line 5: Start Point [0.0, 0.6], End Point [0.0562, 0.6] * Line 6: Start Point [0.0562, 0.6], End Point [0.0562, 0.4875] * Line 7: Start Point [0.0562, 0.4875], End Point [0.0, 0.4875] * Line 8: Start Point [0.0, 0.4875], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Note that the loop is closed, and the sum of the angles of the loops is equal to 360 degrees. Now that we have created the 2D sketch, we will scale it using the sketch\\\\_scale scaling parameter. The scaling parameter is 0.75. Next, we will transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Finally, we will extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.45, and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is 0.0. The sketch scale is 0.75. The boolean operation for this part is to create a new solid body. The dimensions of the part are as follows: * Length: 0.75 * Width: 0.45 * Height: 0.75 Note that the length is measured along the x-axis, the width is measured along the y-axis, and the height is measured along the z-axis. The part is centered on a white background.</description>",

    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism with a Tapered Top and Bottom Step 1: Create the 2D Sketch for the Base Create a new coordinate system with the given Euler angles `[0.0, 0.0, -90.0]` and translation vector `[0.0, 0.0937, 0.0]`. Start by drawing the 2D sketch on a plane defined by this coordinate system. Step 2: Define the Shape of the Base Sketch The base sketch is a closed shape made of six straight lines that form a rectangle with a trapezoid cutout. 1. Draw `line_1` from the coordinate system's origin (0.0, 0.0) to (0.5457, 0.0). 2. Draw `line_2` from (0.5457, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.2043). 3. Draw `line_3` from (0.75, 0.2043) to (0.6094, 0.3281). 4. Draw `line_4` from (0.6094, 0.3281) to (0.4687, 0.1875). 5. Draw `line_5` from (0.4687, 0.1875) to (0.3281, 0.3281). 6. Draw `line_6` from (0.3281, 0.3281) to (0.0, 0.3281). 7. Close the loop with `line_7`, which is the same as `line_1`. Step 3: Scale the 2D Sketch Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 to account for the `sketch_scale` parameter. Step 4: Transform the 2D Sketch into a 3D Sketch Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and the translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Step 5: Extrude the 2D Sketch Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector to define the height of the shape, which is 0.0937. The resulting shape is the 3D model of the first part. The first part is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom. This part has a length of 0.75, a width of 0.0938, and a height of 0.0937.</description>",
