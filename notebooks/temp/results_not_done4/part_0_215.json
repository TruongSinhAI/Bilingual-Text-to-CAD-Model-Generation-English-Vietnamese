Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with the following properties: - Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0017 - Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 - Sketch scale: 0.6882 - Operation: Create a new solid body\\n</description>\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description specifies \\\"Part 1\\\" and \\\"Part 2\\\", indicating two separate parts.\\n\\npart_1:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n  -Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From description).\\n  -Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0086, 0.0] (From description).\\n-sketch:\\n  -face_1:\\n    -loop_1:\\n      -line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.5149, 0.0] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_2: Start Point [0.5149, 0.0], End Point [0.5149, 0.0309] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_3: Start Point [0.5149, 0.0309], End Point [0.0, 0.0309] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.0309], End Point [0.0, 0.0] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n  -face_2:\\n    -loop_1:\\n      -line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.7191], End Point [0.5149, 0.7191] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_2: Start Point [0.5149, 0.7191], End Point [0.5149, 0.75] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_3: Start Point [0.5149, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.7191] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n-extrusion:\\n  -extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0086 (From description: \\\"Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0086\\\").\\n  -extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (From description: \\\"Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0\\\").\\n  -sketch_scale: 0.75 (From description: \\\"Sketch scale: 0.75\\\").\\n  -operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (From description: \\\"Operation: Create a new solid body\\\").\\n\\npart_2:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n  -Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (From description).\\n  -Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0086, 0.0309] (From description).\\n-sketch:\\n  -face_1:\\n    -loop_1:\\n      -line_1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.5149, 0.0] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_2: Start Point [0.5149, 0.0], End Point [0.5149, 0.6882] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_3: Start Point [0.5149, 0.6882], End Point [0.0, 0.6882] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n      -line_4: Start Point [0.0, 0.6882], End Point [0.0, 0.0] (Explicitly stated in description).\\n-extrusion:\\n  -extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0017 (From description: \\\"Extrude depth towards normal: 0.0017\\\").\\n  -extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (From description: \\\"Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0\\\").\\n  -sketch_scale: 0.6882 (From description: \\\"Sketch scale: 0.6882\\\").\\n  -operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (From description: \\\"Operation: Create a new solid body\\\").\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Check Part 1 Coordinate System and Extrusion values: All parameters match the description.\\n-Check Part 1 Sketch connectivity:\\n  -Face 1, Loop 1: Lines 1-4 form a closed rectangle.
