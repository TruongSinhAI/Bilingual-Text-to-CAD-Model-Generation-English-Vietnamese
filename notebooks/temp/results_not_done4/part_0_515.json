    "prompt": "<description>Part 1: 3D Model of a Rectangular Prism with a Curved Top Edge Step 1: Define the Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.15, 0.0]. This will define the position and orientation of the 2D sketch plane in 3D space. Step 2: Draw the 2D Sketch Next, draw the 2D sketch on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch should have a total of 8 lines, each connected end-to-end in a closed loop. The lines should be defined as follows: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.0, 0.0021] - Line 2: Start Point [0.0, 0.0021], End Point [0.0, 0.0945] - Line 3: Start Point [0.0, 0.0945], End Point [0.0, 0.75] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0904, 0.75] - Line 5: Start Point [0.0904, 0.75], End Point [0.0904, 0.0945] - Line 6: Start Point [0.0904, 0.0945], End Point [0.45, 0.0945] - Line 7: Start Point [0.45, 0.0945], End Point [0.45, 0.0] - Line 8: Start Point [0.45, 0.0], End Point [0.0, 0.0] This will result in a closed loop with a straight edge along the bottom and a curved edge along the top. Step 3: Scale the Sketch Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling factor of 0.75. This will adjust the overall size of the sketch, making the length and width 0.75 units and the height 0.75 units. Step 4: Transform the Sketch to 3D Transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. This will position and orient the sketch in 3D space. Step 5: Extrude the Sketch to Generate the 3D Model Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model, extruding towards the normal by a distance of 0.15 units and opposite the normal by a distance of 0.0 units. This will result in a 3D model of a rectangular prism with a curved top edge, with a final height of 0.75 units, a width of 0.15 units, and a length of 0.75 units. The 3D model should be added to the final CAD model as a new solid body.</description>",
