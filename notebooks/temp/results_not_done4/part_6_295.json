Set the Translation Vector to [0.0, 0.75, 0.0] This will create the base for our rectangular prism. Now, let's create the 2D sketch for the prism's base on the XY plane. **Face 1** 1. Create a loop, **loop 1**. - Start the loop with a line, **line 1**: - Set the Start Point as [0.0, 0.0] and the End Point as [0.0937, 0.0] - Continue with a line, **line 2**: - Set the Start Point as [0.0937, 0.0] and the End Point as [0.0937, 0.0937] - Next, create line **line 3**: - Set the Start Point as [0.0937, 0.0937] and the End Point as [0.0, 0.0937] - End the loop with the last line, **line 4**, identical to line 1: - Set the Start Point as [0.0, 0.0937] and the End Point as [0.0, 0.0] The loop is now closed. Now, create another loop, **loop 2**, inside the same sketch to form the inner dimensions of the prism: 1. Start with line **line 1**: - Set the Start Point as [0.0117, 0.0117] and the End Point as [0.082, 0.0117] 2. Create line **line 2**: - Set the Start Point as [0.082, 0.0117] and the End Point as [0.082, 0.082] 3.
