    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: A rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top and bottom** First, let's create a new coordinate system with no rotation or translation. Next, we will create a 2D sketch on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. This sketch will define the profile of the prism. 1. Draw a line from point (0, 0) to point (0.75, 0). 2. Draw a line from point (0.75, 0) to point (0.75, 0.0116). 3. Draw a line from point (0.75, 0.0116) to point (0.75, 0.0736). 4. Draw a line from point (0.75, 0.0736) to point (0.7034, 0.0736). 5. Draw a line from point (0.7034, 0.0736) to point (0.7034, 0.0247). 6. Draw a line from point (0.7034, 0.0247) to point (0.6382, 0.0247). 7. Draw a line from point (0.6382, 0.0247) to point (0.6382, 0.0736). 8. Draw a line from point (0.6382, 0.0736) to point (0.1118, 0.0736). 9.

Draw a line from point (0.0466, 0.0247) to point (0.0466, 0.0736). 12. Draw a line from point (0.0466, 0.0736) to point (0.0, 0.0736). 13. Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.0736) to point (0.0, 0.0116). 14. Draw a line from point (0.0, 0.0116) to point (0.0, 0.0). The sketch is now complete. Notice that there are no circles or arcs, only lines. Also, each loop is closed. Now, we need to scale the sketch by a factor of 0.75. Next, we will transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system. However, in this case, the euler angles are all zero and the translation vector is also zero, so no transformation is needed. Finally, we will extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.0098 units and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is zero. The sketch scale is 0.75. The operation is a \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\", which means a new solid body will be created. The length of this part is 0.75 units, the width is also 0.75 units, and the height is 0.0098 units. With these instructions, a junior CAD designer should be able to generate an accurate CAD model of this part.</description>",
