However, the specified \\\"Boolean operation: Additive\\\" in the description for both parts is interpreted as \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" and \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" in the JSON, respectively. While these JSON operations are common CAD operations for initial body creation and subsequent joining, they are not a literal string match for \\\"Additive\\\". Therefore, there is a minor inconsistency in the `operation` field's specific value vs. the broad term used in the description.\\n</think>"
