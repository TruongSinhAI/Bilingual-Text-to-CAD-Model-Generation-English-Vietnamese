Set the extrusion depth towards the normal (positive Z direction) to 0.527 units, and the extrusion depth opposite the normal (negative Z direction) to 0 units. Apply the scaling factor of 0.75 to the sketch before extrusion. This results in a final solid body. Description For part 1, the 3D model is a rectangular prism with a triangular cutout on one of its faces. The prism is centered on the x-axis and is slightly tilted on the y-axis. The cutout is located on the right side of the prism. The model is symmetrical along the x-axis. The dimensions of the prism are: - length: 0.527 units - width: 0.75 units - height: 0.75 units Note: The curve information is not explicitly provided in the JSON. The description of the curves is inferred from the JSON data and refers to the line segments mentioned above in \"Sketch\" section.</description>",
