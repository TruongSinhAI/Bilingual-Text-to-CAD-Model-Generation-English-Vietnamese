The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 3 units by 4 units. Creating Coordinate System Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] degrees, and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.4851, 0.0]. Creating Sketch on Face 1 Create the first face of the prism (face_1) and then create a loop (loop_1) on this face. 1. **Line 1:** Draw a line from the point (0.0, 0.0) to the point (0.406, 0.0). 2. **Line 2:** Draw a line from the point (0.406, 0.0) to the point (0.4194, 0.0). 3. **Line 3:** Draw a line from the point (0.4194, 0.0) to the point (0.4194, 0.2042). 4. **Line 4:** Draw a line from the point (0.4194, 0.2042) to the point (0.4194, 0.3233). 5. **Line 5:** Draw a line from the point (0.4194, 0.3233) to the point (0.0, 0.3233). 6. **Line 6:** Connect Line 5 to Line 1 and close the loop. Creating Sketch on Face 2 Create the second face of the prism (face_2) and then create a loop (loop_1) on this face. 1. **Line 1:** Draw a line from the point (0.4194, 0.0) to the point (0.75, 0.0). 2. **Line 2:** Draw a line from the point (0.75, 0.0) to the point (0.4194, 0.2042). 3. **Line 3:** Connect Line 2 to Line 1 and close the loop. Extruding Sketch into 3D Solid Now, extrude the 2D sketches into a 3D solid: 1. Set the extrusion depth towards the normal to 0.4851 units. 2. Set the extrusion depth opposite the normal to 0 units. 3. Set the sketch scale to 0.75. 4.
