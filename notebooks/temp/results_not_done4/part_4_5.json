    "prompt": "<description>Part 1 Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 0.75 units by 0.75 units by 0.142 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0003, 0.0001, and 0.1065. Next, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw a rectangle with the following lines: * Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.7497, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point (0.7497, 0.0), End Point (0.7497, 0.556) * Line 3: Start Point (0.7497, 0.556), End Point (0.0, 0.556) * Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.556), End Point (0.0, 0.0) After creating the sketch, scale it using a factor of 0.7497. Then, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.142 units in the positive Z direction to generate the 3D model of the prism. Part 2 Construct a slightly smaller rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The height is approximately twice the width, and the length of the shorter side is about half the length of the longer side. The dimensions of the prism are approximately 0.75 units by 0.75 units by 0.1065 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system with euler angles of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.0, and 0.1065. Next, create a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Draw a rectangle with the following lines: * Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.556) * Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.556), End Point (0.0, 0.556) * Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.556), End Point (0.0, 0.0) After creating the sketch, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector defined in the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch by 0.1065 units in the negative Z direction to generate the 3D model of the prism. Then, join the two extrusions together to form the final shape. The final shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom, where the sides are parallel and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the sides are equal, and the top and bottom faces are slightly smaller than the sides. The middle section is slightly narrower than the top and bottom faces.</description>",

Note that the loop contains 6 line curves. The shape being constructed is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. After you have completed the 2D sketch, proceed by scaling it using a scaling parameter of 0.4381. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the coordinate system's euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model with an extrusion depth towards the normal of 0.3505 and no extrusion in the opposite direction. The sketch scale used for this operation is 0.4381. The resulting shape is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a slightly tapered top. The length of the prism is 0.4381, the width is 0.3505, and the height is 0.4381. **Additional instruction:** Repeat drawing more parts as necessary by substituting the values within the specific coordinate system, sketch, extrusion, and description details provided for each part. Ensure that you close the loop for each face in the sketch if there are multiple lines and/or arcs. Use only simple curves for loops; avoid combining line and circle or arc and circle in a single loop. Make sure you've adapted the operation names to natural language descriptions for clear instructions. For each part, state the shape being constructed, and then proceed with the detailed step-by-step instructions to build that part. Always separate the instructions for each part with clear section breaks and use the `<part_num>` tags to distinguish between parts. Provide all natural instructions in the context of the final shape that you determined for each part. Remember to describe the height, width, and length of each intermediate part and the final shape as prompted in the task.</description>",
