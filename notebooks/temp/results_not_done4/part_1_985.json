The three circles are described as distinct elements, and representing them as `loop_2`, `loop_3`, `loop_4` each containing a `circle_1` object is a standard and valid way to define multiple closed contours (like holes) within a single sketch face in CAD. The center and radius values for all three circles perfectly match the description.\\n  - Extrusion: The `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`, and `operation` all match the description precisely.\\n  - Result: Part 1 fully matches the JSON.\\n\\n- Part 2:\\n  - Coordinate System: The Euler angles and translation vector exactly match the description.\\n  - Sketch: The circle for `loop_1` is correctly defined with its center and radius matching the description.\\n  - Extrusion: The `extrude_depth_towards_normal`, `extrude_depth_opposite_normal`, `sketch_scale`, and `operation` all match the description precisely.\\n  - Result: Part 2 fully matches the JSON.\\n\\n- Overall Correction: The inferred JSON structure and values, including the interpretation of multiple circles as separate loops, perfectly align with the cleaned description.
