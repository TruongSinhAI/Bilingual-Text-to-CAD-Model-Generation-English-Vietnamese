The tapered top is a tapered cylindrical object, as constructed in Part 2. The overall length of the object is the sum of the length of the base and the extrusion depth of the top. The width is equal to the width of the base. The height is the sum of the height of the base and the height of the tapered top. The material of the object is metallic. The colors and textures of the object can be determined by the designer. The object has the following dimensions: * Length: 1.0 (sum of Part 1 length and Part 2 length) * Width: 0.625 (width of Part 1 and base of Part 2) * Height: 1.1875 (sum of Part 1 height and Part 2 height)</description>",
