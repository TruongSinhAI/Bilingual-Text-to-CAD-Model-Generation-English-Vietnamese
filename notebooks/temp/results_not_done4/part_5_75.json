The JSON, however, specifies a `\\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\"`. This is a direct contradiction between the descriptive intent (\"\n    ,\n    \"construct\"\n    ,\n    \") and the actual CAD operation (`\\\"Cut\\\"`).\\n\\n- Part 3 Consistency:\\n  - Coordinate system, sketch (circle), extrusion depths, sketch scale, and operation all match the JSON and are logically consistent (another new body or join operation).\\n\\nCorrection: The primary issue is that the `operation` for `part_2` is `\\\"CutFeatureOperation\\\"` in the JSON, but the description implies an additive operation (\"\n    ,\n    \"Construct\"\n    ,\n    \"). This is a significant discrepancy.\\n</think>"
