The length and width are approximately 0.75 units, and the height is slightly more than half the length, at approximately 0.0816 units. The part is centered on a white background. Note: The shapes, curves, loops, and faces are described in detail in the CAD assembly JSON provided. The junior CAD designer can refer to this information to generate an accurate CAD model. Additionally, the boolean operation of the current part with the preceding CAD models is described as \"addition\" or \"joining\" of material. This is in line with the natural language descriptions mentioned in the instructions and avoids the use of specific boolean operation terms such as 'NewBodyFeatureOperation', 'CutFeatureOperation' etc.</description>",
