This will be the base for our first part. Next, create the 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. 1. The first face, `face_1`, of the sketch contains two loops, `loop_1` and `loop_2`. 2. `loop_1` consists of four lines: * `line_1` starts at [0.0, 0.0] and ends at [0.03, 0.0]. * `line_2` starts at [0.03, 0.0] and ends at [0.03, 0.03]. * `line_3` starts at [0.03, 0.03] and ends at [0.0, 0.03]. * `line_4` starts at [0.0, 0.03] and ends at [0.0, 0.0]. 3. `loop_2` is a circle centered at [0.015, 0.015] with a radius of 0.0038. Once the 2D sketch is complete, apply a scale transformation using the scaling parameter 0.03. This will scale the entire sketch. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. To do this, apply the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model: * Extrude by 0.75 units in the normal direction and 0.0 units in the opposite direction of the normals. * Apply the `sketch_scale` of 0.03 to the sketch before extrusion. * Since this is the first part, use the `NewBodyFeatureOperation` operation. This means the 3D model will be created as a new solid body. Here's the final description of the part: * Shape: A simple, rectangular prism with a slightly tapered end. * Length: 0.03 units. * Width: 0.03 units. * Height: 0.75 units.</description>",
