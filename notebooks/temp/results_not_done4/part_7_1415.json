    "prompt": "<description>**Part 1: Three-Dimensional Rectangular Prism** The first part of the CAD assembly is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel and meet at right angles. The dimensions are 2 units in length, 1 unit in width, and 0.5 units in height. 1. **Create a new coordinate system.** Set the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. This will serve as the reference for the 2D sketch that forms the foundation of the prism. 2. **Draw the 2D sketch.** Sketch a rectangle on the XY plane of the coordinate system as follows: a. Draw the first line from the point [0.0, 0.0] to the point [0.7268, 0.0]. b. Draw the second line from the point [0.7268, 0.0] to the point [0.7268, 0.75]. c. Draw the third line from the point [0.7268, 0.75] to the point [0.0, 0.75]. d. Draw the fourth line from the point [0.0, 0.75] to the point [0.0, 0.0]. The sketch should now form a closed rectangle. 3. **Scale the 2D sketch.** Apply a uniform scale of 0.75 to the sketch. This will ensure that the length and width of the prism are 0.75 units. 4. **Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch.** Set the extrusion direction to be normal to the sketch plane and define the extrusion depth as 0.0232 units in the positive normal direction and 0 units in the negative normal direction. This will create a prism with a height of 0.0232 units. 5. **Extrude the 2D sketch.** The extruded shape will be the three-dimensional rectangular prism based on the 2D sketch. The resulting prism should match the dimensions specified in the description. This constitutes the first part of the CAD assembly. Continue with the same process for subsequent parts as required.</description>",
