Next, create the 2D sketch for this part. The sketch consists of two faces. Face 1 contains a single loop (loop_1) with four lines. - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0], End Point [0.6061, 0.0] - Line 2: Start Point [0.6061, 0.0], End Point [0.6061, 0.75] - Line 3: Start Point [0.6061, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.75] - Line 4: Start Point [0.0, 0.75], End Point [0.0, 0.0] Face 2 contains a single loop (loop_2) with two arcs and two lines. - Arc 1: Start Point [0.2358, 0.3077], Mid Point [0.3031, 0.2405], End Point [0.3703, 0.3077] - Line 1: Start Point [0.3703, 0.3077], End Point [0.3703, 0.4423] - Arc 2: Start Point [0.3703, 0.4423], Mid Point [0.3031, 0.5095], End Point [0.2358, 0.4423] - Line 2: Start Point [0.2358, 0.4423], End Point [0.2358, 0.3077] Each loop is closed and forms a complete face. The first face is a rectangle and the second face is a slightly offset ellipse. After creating the 2D sketch, scale it using the sketch_scale parameter which is 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D Sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Then, extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. Set the extrude_depth_towards_normal to 0.2691 and keep the extrude_depth_opposite_normal at 0.0. The final measurements for this part are as follows: - Length: 0.75 units - Width: 0.75 units - Height: 0.2691 units This part represents the base for the final shape, a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center. The hole is slightly off-center from the top of the prism and the prism is placed on a flat surface.</description>",
