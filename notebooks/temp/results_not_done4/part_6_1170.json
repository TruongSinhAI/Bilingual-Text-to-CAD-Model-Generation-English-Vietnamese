Perform a JoinFeatureOperation with the previously created body to add the extruded rounded rectangle to it.\\n</description>\\nS2:\\n<valid>Yes</valid>\\nS3:\\n<think>\\n***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:\\n\\nparts: The description specifies \\\"Part 1\\\" and \\\"Part 2\\\", indicating two distinct parts.\\n\\npart_1:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n  --Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description)\\n  --Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description)\\n-sketch:\\n  --face_1: (from \\\"face 1\\\")\\n    ---loop_1:\\n      ----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.375], End [0.75, 0.0] (from description)\\n      ----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.75] (from description)\\n      ----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.75], End [0.375, 0.75] (from description)\\n      ----line_4: Start [0.375, 0.75], End [0.375, 0.375] (from description)\\n      ----line_5: Start [0.375, 0.375], End [0.0, 0.375] (from description)\\n  --face_2: (from \\\"face 2\\\")\\n    ---loop_1:\\n      ----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.375], End [0.375, 0.375] (from description)\\n      ----line_2: Start [0.375, 0.375], End [0.375, 0.75] (from description)\\n      ----line_3: Start [0.375, 0.75], End [0.0, 0.75] (from description)\\n      ----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.75], End [0.0, 0.375] (from description)\\n-extrusion:\\n  --extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.1875 (from description)\\n  --extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (inferred, not specified)\\n  --sketch_scale: 0.75 (from description)\\n  --operation: \\\"NewBodyFeatureOperation\\\" (from description: \\\"create a new solid body\\\")\\n\\npart_2:\\n-coordinate_system:\\n  --Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (from description)\\n  --Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.375, 0.0] (from description)\\n-sketch:\\n  --face_1: (from \\\"face 1\\\")\\n    ---loop_1:\\n      ----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.375, 0.0] (from description)\\n      ----line_2: Start [0.375, 0.0], End [0.375, 0.375] (from description)\\n      ----line_3: Start [0.375, 0.375], End [0.0, 0.375] (from description)\\n      ----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.375], End [0.0, 0.0] (from description)\\n-extrusion:\\n  --extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.5625 (from description)\\n  --extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (inferred, not specified)\\n  --sketch_scale: 0.375 (from description)\\n  --operation: \\\"JoinFeatureOperation\\\" (from description: \\\"Perform a JoinFeatureOperation\\\")\\n\\n***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:\\n\\n-Part 1:\\n  -Coordinate system: Euler Angles and Translation Vector match exactly.\\n  -Sketch:\\n    -`face_1` `loop_1`: The points for all 5 lines match the JSON.
