    "prompt": "<description>**Intermediate CAD Part 1** Construct a three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.2805, 0.0]. This will position and orient the prism appropriately for the next steps. To create the 2D sketch, draw a rectangle on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The rectangle should have four lines, with the following start and end points: - Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.0] - Line 2: [0.75, 0.0] to [0.75, 0.3295] - Line 3: [0.75, 0.3295] to [0.0, 0.3295] - Line 4: [0.0, 0.3295] to [0.0, 0.0] Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75 using the sketch_scale parameter. This ensures the prism has the correct dimensions. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Then, extrude the sketch along the normal vector with a depth of 0.1407. This will create the 3D model of the prism. **Intermediate CAD Part 2** Construct a cylindrical object with a flat top and bottom. The height of the cylinder is approximately three times the diameter. The object is symmetrical along its central axis. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.2534, 0.1398, 0.0432]. To create the 2D sketch, draw a circle on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The circle should have the following properties: - Center: [0.1216, 0.1216] - Radius: 0.1216 Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.2431 using the sketch_scale parameter. This ensures the cylinder has the correct dimensions. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Then, extrude the sketch along the normal vector with a depth of 0.2431. This will create the 3D model of the cylinder. **Intermediate CAD Part 3** Construct a rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. The sides are parallel, and the top and bottom faces are perpendicular to the sides. The dimensions of the prism are 2 units by 4 units by 6 units. Begin by creating a new coordinate system. Set the euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.2411, -0.0146, 0.1647]. To create the 2D sketch, draw a triangle on the X-Y plane of the coordinate system. The triangle should have three lines, with the following start and end points: - Line 1: [0.0, 0.0] to [0.3232, 0.0] - Line 2: [0.3232, 0.0] to [0.0, 0.0696] - Line 3: [0.0, 0.0696] to [0.0, 0.0] Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.3232 using the sketch_scale parameter. This ensures the prism has the correct proportions. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch by applying the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Then, extrude the sketch along the normal vector with a depth of 0.1407. This will create the 3D model of the prism. **Final CAD Model** Combine the three intermediate parts to create the final CAD model. Position and orient the parts relative to each other using the coordinate systems and extrusion depths specified in the JSON. Use the appropriate boolean operation described in the JSON for each part to integrate it with preceding CAD models. The resulting CAD model should resemble a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center.</description>",
