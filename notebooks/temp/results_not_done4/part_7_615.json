Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the sketches into 3D sketches using the euler angles and translation vector of the coordinate system. Extrude the sketch along the Z-axis with a depth of 0.0073 units towards the normal and 0.0 units opposite to the normal. The sketch scale is 0.75. This results in the creation of a new solid body with the desired shape. The length, width, and height of the intermediate part are 0.75 units, 0.0073 units, and 0.75 units, respectively. The final shape is a long, thin, cylindrical object with a slightly tapered end and a series of evenly spaced holes along its length. The CAD model is now complete with the desired shape and properties.</description>",
