The loop consists of a total of eleven lines that form a closed shape. Now transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the provided coordinate system. Scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.75. Next, extrude the 2D sketch along the normal to create depth. Set the extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_towards\\\\_normal to 0.25 units. No extrusion is required in the opposite direction, so set extrude\\\\_depth\\\\_opposite\\\\_normal to 0.0. Because part 1 is the first and only part in this assembly, the extruded CAD feature serves as the final solid body for this shape. Apply the \"NewBodyFeatureOperation\" operation for the first part. At this point, you've constructed a three-dimensional, abstract geometric shape with interconnected, triangular facets.
