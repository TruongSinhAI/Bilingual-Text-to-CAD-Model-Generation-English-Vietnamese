Begin by creating a new coordinate system. For this part, the euler angles are [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector is [0.0, 0.0612, 0.0]. Now let's generate the 2D sketch for this part. Create a new face, face_1. Within this face, we will draw two loops, loop_1 and loop_2. In loop_1, we will draw five lines. - line_1: Start Point = [0.0, 0.75], End Point = [0.2356, 0.1722] - line_2: Start Point = [0.2356, 0.1722], End Point = [0.3059, 0.0] - line_3: Start Point = [0.3059, 0.0], End Point = [0.5891, 0.0] - line_4: Start Point = [0.5891, 0.0], End Point = [0.5891, 0.75] - line_5: Start Point = [0.5891, 0.75], End Point = [0.0, 0.75] Loop_1 is a closed loop, and it forms the outer boundary of the rectangular prism. In loop_2, we will draw a circle. - circle_1: Center = [0.2356, 0.435], Radius = 0.0283 Loop_2 is also a closed loop, and it forms the inner boundary of the rectangular prism, creating a cylindrical hole in the center. Now, let's transform the 2D sketch into a 3D sketch. The euler angles and translation vector provided in the coordinate system will be used for this transformation. The final step is to extrude the 2D sketch to generate the 3D model. The extrusion depth towards the normal is 0.0306 and the extrusion depth opposite the normal is also 0.0306. The sketch scale is 0.75. The operation is a \"New Body Feature Operation\", which means a new solid body will be created from this extrusion. The length of this intermediate CAD part is 0.75, the width is 0.0612, and the height is 0.75. The final shape, a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole in the center, will be created by combining this part with subsequent parts according to the operations defined.</description>",
