It contains three separate partsâ€”a cylindrical object with a tapered top and bottom, a cylindrical object with a tapered end, and a cylindrical object with a tapered middle section. The dimensions of the model are as follows: * Length (total): 0.1023 m (Part 1: 0.034 m, Part 2: 0.034 m, Part 3: 0.034 m) * Width (diameter): 0.375 m (Part 2: 0.375 m) * Height (entire assembly): 0.4003 m, noting that Part 3 has a zero-thickness middle section. Please double-check these dimensions in your CAD software and ensure that the Boolean operations (joins, cuts, intersections, or new bodies) are accurately defined in accordance with the provided instructions.</description>",
