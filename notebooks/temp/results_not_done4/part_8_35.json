Use the following parameters for the Euler angles and translation vector: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] For the 2D sketch, you need to draw a square with rounded corners and then scale it. 1. Sketch a square on the X-Y plane with the following sides: * Line 1: 0.0, 0.0 to 0.376, 0.0 * Line 2: 0.376, 0.0 to 0.376, 0.2757 * Line 3: 0.376, 0.2757 to 0.0, 0.2757 * Line 4: 0.0, 0.2757 to 0.0, 0.0 2. Scale the square using a scaling factor of 0.376. Next, transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch: 1. Set the euler angle rotation of the sketch on the X-Y-Z axes as follows: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] 2. Set the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] so that the scaled 2D sketch is centered at the origin. Finally, extrude the 3D sketch: 1. Extrude the 3D sketch with the following parameters: * Extrude depth towards normal: 0.75 * Extrude depth opposite normal: 0.0 * Sketch scale: 0.376 * Operation: Create a new solid body Now, you have constructed a three-dimensional rectangular prism with rounded corners.
