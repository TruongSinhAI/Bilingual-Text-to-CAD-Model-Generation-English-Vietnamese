Begin by creating a new coordinate system: * Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] * Translation Vector: [0.1339, 0.1339, 0.3482] The sketch for this part contains a single face (face_1) and a loop (loop_1) encompassing four lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, and line_4).

This is a significant mismatch.\\n  - Extrusion parameters and operation match the JSON.\\n  - Result: Mismatch due to incorrect reference for rectangle dimensions.\\n\\nOverall, the description does not fully match the JSON due to a discrepancy in the geometric description of Part 1 (rounded corners not in sketch) and an incorrect reference for the dimensions of Part 2's rectangular sketch.\\n</think>"
