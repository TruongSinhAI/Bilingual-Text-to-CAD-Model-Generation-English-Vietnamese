Begin by creating a new coordinate system with the following properties: Coordinate System: - Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] - Translation Vector: [0.0055, 0.75, 0.0] Next, create the sketch for the part on the plane defined by the coordinate system. The sketch consists of four faces (face\\\\_1, face\\\\_2, face\\\\_3, and face\\\\_4) and each face contains one loop, made up of lines and arcs. Face 1: - Loop 1: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.0833], End Point [0.0862, 0.0833] - Arc 1: Start Point [0.0862, 0.0833], Mid Point [0.1136, 0.0741], End Point [0.1409, 0.0833] - Line 2: Start Point [0.1409, 0.0833], End Point [0.2272, 0.0833] - Arc 2: Start Point [0.2272, 0.0833], Mid Point [0.1136, 0.0], End Point [0.0, 0.0833] Face 2: - Loop 1: - Line 1: Start Point [0.0, 0.1548], End Point [0.0862, 0.1548] - Arc 1: Start Point [0.0862, 0.1548], Mid Point [0.1136, 0.1641], End Point [0.1409, 0.1548] - Line 2: Start Point [0.1409, 0.1548], End Point [0.2272, 0.1548] - Arc 2: Start Point [0.2272, 0.1548], Mid Point [0.1136, 0.2381], End Point [0.0, 0.1548] Face 3: - Loop 1: - Arc 1: Start Point [0.0862, 0.0833], Mid Point [0.1136, 0.0741], End Point [0.1409, 0.0833] - Line 1: Start Point [0.1409, 0.0833], End Point [0.0862, 0.0833] Face 4: - Loop 1: - Arc 1: Start Point [0.0862, 0.1548], Mid Point [0.1136, 0.1641], End Point [0.1409, 0.1548] - Line 1: Start Point [0.1409, 0.1548], End Point [0.0862, 0.1548] Now, scale the 2D sketch using a scaling parameter of 0.2381. After scaling, transform the sketch into a 3D sketch using the euler angles and translation vector from the coordinate system. Finally, extrude the 2D sketch along the normal vector to create the 3D model, with an extrusion depth of 0.75 and no extrusion in the opposite direction. This operation creates a new solid body. The length, width, and height of the part are 0.2381, 0.75, and 0.2381, respectively, as described in the CAD Assembly JSON.</description>",
