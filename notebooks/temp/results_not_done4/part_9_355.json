When multiple closed loops are part of a single sketch face for extrusion, inner loops typically define holes or cutouts. Thus, `loop_2` would likely create a circular hole, not a \\\"curved top\\\" for the overall prism.\\n    - The description states `loop_3` through `loop_6` are for \\\"fillets\\\". Similarly, these are defined as full circles at the corners within the sketch. In CAD, fillets are typically arcs that smoothly transition between two edges, not full circles. If these circles are internal loops, they would create circular holes at the corners, not rounded edges. For them to be fillets, they would typically be represented as arc segments replacing the sharp corners of `loop_1`, or a specific fillet feature would be needed. Their representation as separate loops implies holes/cutouts if extruded with `loop_1` as the outer boundary.\\n- Check extrusion: Extrusion parameters (depths and scale) match the JSON.\\n\\n- Correction: The interpretation of the sketch geometry in the description is semantically inconsistent with how CAD software typically processes multiple closed loops within a single sketch for extrusion. \\\"Curved top\\\" is misleading for an internal circle, and \\\"fillets\\\" are misleading for full internal circles at corners. These circles, as internal loops, would result in holes, not a curved top surface or rounded outer edges.\\n</think>"
